642
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,720
a puma cotton

643
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,840
blend t-shirt on Vince's site cost $85

644
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,480
but the same shirt sells for $29.99 at

645
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,279
TJ Maxx so why does it cost less over 10

646
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,520
years the off-price retailer has opened

647
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,039
263 more stores in 2022 TJX which owns

648
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,679
TJ Maxx Marshalls and Homegoods brought

649
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,480
in almost $50 billion in sales revenue

650
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,159
more than Nordstrom's and Macy's

651
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:27,840
combined and the secret to its success

652
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,799
the company isn't shifting most of its

653
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,000
business online or using big data to

654
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,399
figure out what Shoppers want instead

655
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,880
it's sticking to a decades old Playbook

656
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
get the max for

657
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,760
minimim

658
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,480
[Music]

659
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,279
it's this is the economics of TJ Maxx

660
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,120
there are really two components to TJ

661
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,399
Maxx's strategy the bargain and the hunt

662
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:55,720
One Way TJ Maxx gets discounted Goods is

663
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,880
by buying excess merchandise and cancel

664
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,240
orders from other brands and retailers

665
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,960
essentially it takes advantage of

666
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,520
surplus and waste in the retail system

667
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,000
this allows the company to sell its

668
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,679
merchandise generally around 20 to 60%

669
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,240
below regular retail prices but there's

670
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,640
a catch just the fact that the price is

671
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,320
low is not enough what you need is also

672
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,679
a reference price because people don't

673
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:20,679
know how much things cost that's where

674
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,200
Alex says something known as the

675
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,159
anchoring effect comes in at TJ Maxx

676
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,200
most items have two prices the T J Maxx

677
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,039
price and a comparison price people

678
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,279
anchor the the regular price and then

679
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,919
they see exactly how much of a deal

680
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,799
they're getting and this way they really

681
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,600
understand what the value is that DJ

682
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,640
Maxx provides to them take these Rag and

683
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,200
Bone shorts a TJ Maxx in Manhattan sold

684
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,279
them for about $40 with a comparison

685
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,559
price of $50 that's a 20% discount but

686
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,480
the original price tag happened to be on

687
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,760
these shorts and it lists the price as

688
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,279
$195 that would be around 80% discount

689
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,240
and that comparison price is really just

690
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,000
an estimate on TJ Maxx's website there's

691
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,840
a message next to the comparison price

692
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,919
that says these prices are references to

693
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,080
regular retail prices where identical

694
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,159
items are not available we compare to

695
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,240
products of a similar type quality and

696
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,840
style these price tags aren't the only

697
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,080
way TJ Max helps customers feel like

698
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,159
they're getting a bargain the whole

699
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,039
positioning of of TJ Maxx is U if we

700
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,240
give you brand names for Less

701
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,960
and the reason why it's important is

702
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,039
because very often when you see low

703
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,159
price uh you think it's low price

704
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,720
because the quality of the product is

705
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,919
low but if the customer knows and trusts

706
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,440
the brand then they won't assume the

707
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,799
price is low because it's a bad product

708
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,440
instead Alex says they'll attribute it

709
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,840
to TJ Maxx's ability to get discounted

710
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
goods and because people often expect

711
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,120
name brand items to be more expensive

712
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,360
the brand itself acts as an anchor

713
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,760
emphasizing the fact that as a customer

714
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,000
you're getting a

715
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
deal uh makes people feel good it's not

716
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,360
only I'm getting a low price but I'm

717
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,240
actually getting a deal uh which makes

718
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,640
people feel good about themselves that

719
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,440
they're smart Shoppers TJ Maxx says it

720
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,080
gets its goods from about 21,000 vendors

721
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,799
and the inventory in its stores is

722
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,640
constantly turning so as a result people

723
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,240
tend to go more often to this type of

724
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,559
stores and also spend a little bit more

725
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,000
time in the store in search of something

726
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,200
across its companies TJX employs more

727
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,360
than 1200 buyers that each control

728
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,320
millions of dollars and has authority to

729
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,480
cut deals on the spot as a buyer for TJ

730
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
Maxx I'm always on the hunt let's say

731
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,200
you have a bathing suit brand and it's

732
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
the right before Memorial Day weekend

733
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,640
and they're stuck with extra bathing

734
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,919
suits that's when TJ Maxx buyers show up

735
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:45,120
at the showroom you know they can cut a

736
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,960
deal right on the spot and they can get

737
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,080
it to their stores within a week

738
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,679
department stores on the other hand can

739
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,519
take weeks to review and approve orders

740
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,799
from their buyers so TJ MOX buys the

741
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,880
merchandise quickly and gets it into the

742
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,360
store just as fast they have a saying

743
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,159
internally door to floor in 24 meaning

744
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,080
that any merchandise that shows up at a

745
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,519
store in the morning has to be on the

746
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,840
sales floor by the end of that day to

747
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,000
ensure speed merchandise often arrives

748
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,480
at stores already on racks that

749
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,360
employees wheel off trucks and move

750
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,240
straight onto the sales floor and once

751
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,320
it's there all the merchandise is laid

752
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,360
out differently than other retailers too

753
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,159
helping to create that treasure hunt

754
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,279
experience while most department stores

755
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,039
group items by brand TJ Maxx organizes

756
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,440
its inventory by type this means that

757
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,080
different brands can end up next to each

758
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,480
other on the same racks and since TJ

759
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,039
Maxx doesn't have walls dividing

760
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,480
sections of the stores or Brands it can

761
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,200
easily reconfigure the layout based on

762
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,519
changing inventory seeing all the

763
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,960
products and changing layout can

764
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
encourage impulse buying Shoppers know

765
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,480
that if they see something they like

766
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,600
they need to buy it now if they wait it

767
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,399
may be sold out or hard to find when

768
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:52,440
they come back once you take it home

769
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,320
things are changing dramatically because

770
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,399
now you're not buying something you you

771
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:59,480
are giving up something lots of research

772
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,279
has shown that giving up something is

773
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,919
more difficult than acquiring you're

774
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,760
willing to uh pay more uh not to give up

775
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,320
something than to buy something

776
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,840
retailers struggled through the rise of

777
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,120
e-commerce in the pandemic and while TJ

778
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,640
X's off-price retailers still took a hit

779
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,640
they have bounced back in 2021 TJX had

780
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,159
the highest sales in the company's

781
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,440
history a record it then beat the

782
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,760
following year and it's not because TJ

783
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,480
Maxx and the other off-price retailers

784
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,559
adapted but rather because they never

785
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,960
drifted away from their core strategy TJ

786
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,919
Maxx tends to perform pretty well in an

787
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,559
economic downturn because that's when

788
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,880
customers tend to be bargain conscious

789
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,799
and you know they offer really good

790
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,039
value for the money
