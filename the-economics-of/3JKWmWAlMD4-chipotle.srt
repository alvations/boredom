454
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,520
spaces Chipotle's menu only has a few

455
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,120
items but it's highly customizable born

456
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,919
in 1993 that's what's made Chipotle one

457
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:02,919
of the most successful fast casual

458
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,200
restaurant chains in the US but in

459
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
recent years Chipotle's faced many

460
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,360
challenges between 2015 to 2018 Chipotle

461
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,440
dealt with five foodborn illness

462
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,520
outbreaks like most of the restaurant

463
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,799
industry Chipotle's Revenue took a big

464
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,440
hit during the beginning of the coron

465
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,039
virus pandemic and today it's dealing

466
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,159
with inflation that's increased labor

467
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:26,679
transportation and food costs yet

468
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,880
despite these setbacks Chipotle sales

469
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
are actually growing here's how

470
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,320
Chipotle's focus on efficiency and

471
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,480
Innovation helped it bounce back and

472
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,159
become one of the country's most

473
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,679
valuable Quick Service chains this is

474
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,159
the economics of

475
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,480
Chipotle Chipotle's Revenue has

476
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,039
increased by more than 200% over the

477
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,120
past decade its stock price has

478
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,280
increased about 400% in The Last 5 Years

479
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
much of Chipotle's success comes from

480
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,640
its efficient and what it calls

481
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,240
transparent instore experience Chipotle

482
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,600
has really in a lot of ways made the

483
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,039
whole fast casual category for

484
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,280
restaurants it's not fast food it's not

485
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,600
full service they've generated a lot of

486
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,679
sales from people who want this

487
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,840
alternative that's seems fresher and

488
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,840
faster than fast food but it's not a

489
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,440
full service experience fast casual

490
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,960
design can help them reduce some of

491
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
their labor expenses which helps with

492
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,480
profits Chipotle's menu is relatively

493
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,720
small but it's easy to customize there's

494
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,159
tons of stuff you can put on your meal

495
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,840
that's proteins that's cheeses that's

496
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,960
vegetables that's all the salsas and

497
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,480
sauces and for customer that makes it

498
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,039
exciting you know they get lots of

499
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,240
different things they can customize

500
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,760
their meal with the more limited menu in

501
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,400
general is better for restaurants and

502
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,600
their profits it's less things to train

503
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,880
the restaurant workers on it's less

504
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,760
waste Chipotle's founder Steve ell

505
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,039
emphasized having an open kitchen he

506
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,679
wanted customers to be able to see the

507
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,559
ingredients and preparation in front of

508
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,520
them today employees work at individual

509
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,280
stations to serve already prepared

510
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,400
ingredients making the ordering process

511
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,520
more efficient for customers we can

512
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,000
serve as many as 100 customers within a

513
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,720
15-minute period what's a better way

514
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,320
than telling people that it's fresh

515
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,640
showing them let them come in and

516
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,960
discover for themselves this

517
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
transparency has been very important for

518
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,320
Chipotle especially after its food

519
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,960
safety issues after several outbreaks of

520
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,600
eoli salmonella and norovirus in

521
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Chipotle restaurants the company

522
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,320
implemented several changes like

523
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
improving food preparation and storage

524
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,520
procedures encouraging sick employees to

525
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,400
stay at home and bringing on a new CEO

526
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,120
Brian nickel he really did emphasize

527
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,440
that they cleaned up their procedures

528
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,640
didn't happen immediately but with time

529
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
people start to forget things too there

530
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,520
hasn't been the big high-profile scares

531
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
that there were previously after several

532
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,400
outbreaks between 2015 and 2018

533
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,679
Chipotle's stock price took a hit

534
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,480
however its focus on its digital

535
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,600
ordering platforms helped Drive drive up

536
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,919
revenue and stock prices started to

537
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:04,039
climb back in 2008 Chipotle became one

538
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,960
of the first fast casual chains to

539
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,400
create an online store pickup model in

540
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,760
its first year Chipotle's digital sales

541
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,919
accounted for $13 million or just 1% of

542
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,240
its total sales in 2022 digital sales

543
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,600
grew to $3.4 billion that's now nearly

544
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,799
40% of Chipotle's food and beverage

545
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,080
Revenue if you're ordering online

546
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,120
digitally that is made for you at a

547
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,559
whole separate part of the kitchen which

548
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,799
is just dedicated to online orders

549
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,559
Chipotle's app and online ordering

550
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,400
systems were also vital during the

551
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,279
pandemic the pandemic obviously was

552
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,200
terrible for all restaurants but

553
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,360
Chipotle did have some advantages there

554
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,279
in that they had this whole digital

555
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,880
ordering platform really set up and

556
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,480
scaled beforehand when the pandemic

557
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,200
first hit we saw that people stopped

558
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,559
going to restaurants for some period of

559
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,880
time so we saw our sales drop uh pretty

560
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,000
significantly but it only took like a

561
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,960
week or two before we started to see

562
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,200
that while they first stopped visiting

563
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,640
restaurants the adoption of the digital

564
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,559
ordering really picked up very very

565
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,039
quickly and so I would say within the

566
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,159
first four weeks we had our digital uh

567
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,159
uh ordering soore from about 18% to it

568
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:15,640
at one point hit 70% Chipotle also

569
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,480
designed its stores to have two separate

570
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,039
prep stations called make lines one make

571
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,640
line is just for inore orders and the

572
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,520
other is for digital and Catering orders

573
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
this made food pickups quicker for

574
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
customers who didn't want to spend time

575
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,559
indoors this idea that we had the

576
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,320
digital make line so that as people were

577
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,919
ordering we could make food on the

578
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,799
digital make line and also serve

579
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,600
customers that were choosing to come in

580
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,799
so it was a seamless experience like

581
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,360
most stocks during 2020 they were still

582
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,240
lower than they were before the pandemic

583
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,919
but by the end of the first year into

584
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,240
the second year most stocks had you know

585
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,080
fully recovered we had our all-time high

586
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,039
in 2021 recently Chipotle has continued

587
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,279
to expand its digital ordering services

588
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,440
with a new pickup option for customers

589
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,600
called chipot Lanes let's go ahead and

590
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,279
take offer all the convenience of the

591
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,480
drivethru but when you order ahead of

592
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,600
time you know exactly what time to come

593
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,840
and so there's no ly you drive up and

594
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,279
you pull to our window you get your food

595
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,159
and off you go the first chipot Lane

596
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,679
opened in 2018 and there are already

597
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,000
nearly 600 across the US Chipotle says

598
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,320
at least 80% of new restaurant locations

599
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,240
opening in 20123 will have chipot Lanes

600
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
but that's just one example of how

601
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,960
Chipotle has continued to innovate to

602
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,080
attract customers social media has been

603
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,200
great for us because in addition to

604
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
making sure we're serving you know the

605
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,279
meals that that customers come to expect

606
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,200
at Chipotle we also want to be part of

607
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,480
culture Chipotle frequently uses social

608
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,440
media to attract younger consumers by

609
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,240
releasing recipe videos animated short

610
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,440
films Roblox games and social media

611
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,240
campaigns like the lid flip challenge

612
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
with major influencers Chipotle has also

613
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,400
used social media to drum up excitement

614
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,480
about new menu items and innovate its

615
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,640
menu options to keep up with consumer

616
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,960
Trends adding new things for customers

617
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,679
is very important to Chipotle and they

618
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,520
have a whole process for this where they

619
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,640
try and try these items in house really

620
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,840
test and learn before they test in

621
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,520
stores they like menu news whether it's

622
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,120
you know a steak item or a chicken item

623
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,240
alpastor quesadillas they want to keep

624
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,880
customers interested even if most of

625
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,520
their menu is staying the same so what's

626
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,000
next for Chipotle in general the online

627
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
ordering even when you pick it up in the

628
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,480
restaurant is just much more efficient

629
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,320
the company says it wants to open more

630
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,480
locations that are only used for online

631
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,440
pickup orders they won't have any

632
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,240
seating for customers this will also cut

633
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,399
down on labor costs since workers won't

634
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,000
need to clean seating areas and

635
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,200
bathrooms as often we think the idea is

636
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,760
let the customers choose which channel
