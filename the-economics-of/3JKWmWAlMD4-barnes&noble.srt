1111
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,280
this Barnes

1112
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,200
& Noble in Pikesville Maryland used to

1113
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,280
be in a 24,000 ft space in this building

1114
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280
now it's moved across the street to a

1115
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,359
space that's less than half the

1116
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,079
size and with the downsizing came a new

1117
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,160
look and new books chosen specifically

1118
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,880
for this store's customers it's all part

1119
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,920
of Barnes & Noble strategy to tailor

1120
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,800
each of the company's more than 600

1121
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,800
location to local tastes Barnes & Noble

1122
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,839
is adopting the strategy of independent

1123
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,559
bookstores that it once put out of

1124
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,480
business here's how the book seller is

1125
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,640
implementing its new approach and why it

1126
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,960
thinks this new strategy will sell more

1127
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,920
books this is the economics of Barnes

1128
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,910
and

1129
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,040
[Music]

1130
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,559
Noble Barnes & Noble was first founded

1131
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,880
in 1873 in 1971 Leonard Rio acquired the

1132
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,440
company which set off a period of growth

1133
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,200
the retailer went public in 1993 in an

1134
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,119
era when it was opening Superstores

1135
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:31,240
across the country in the 1990s and

1136
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,599
2000s Barnes & Noble bookstores really

1137
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,000
looked like large supermarkets filled

1138
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,079
with books usually anchoring strip

1139
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,920
centers in the suburbs or rural areas

1140
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,200
and whether in Phoenix or Maryland or

1141
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,640
Ohio the stores had the same books with

1142
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,040
the same furniture and the same layout

1143
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,480
it either had one floor or it had two if

1144
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,680
had two it had enormous escalators going

1145
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,119
out with this huge sort of open space in

1146
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:58,319
the middle to an upper floor that model

1147
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,599
happened to be extremely scalable they

1148
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,760
were trying to fill their stores with

1149
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,280
books and infrastructure at the lowest

1150
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,319
cost possible so they wanted to order

1151
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,240
all the same types of bookshelves the

1152
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,800
same type of furnishings and decorations

1153
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,839
and other autra mths so the company grew

1154
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:17,839
and fast those huge stores carried more

1155
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,880
books at lower prices than independent

1156
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,920
book stores we all remember the romcom

1157
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,400
new got mail Joe Fox I'm in the book

1158
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,800
business I am in the book business so

1159
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,640
many closed when Barnes & Noble came to

1160
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,480
town they weren't able to compete with

1161
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,640
the title selection or prices that

1162
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,119
Barnes Noble offered but big stores and

1163
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,240
large inventories weren't enough to save

1164
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,640
Barnes & Noble from a digital threat

1165
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,079
Amazon was able to offer kind of like

1166
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,200
Barnes & Noble had in the past a huge

1167
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,400
selection of titles at lower prices than

1168
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,960
Barnes & Noble could because it didn't

1169
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,440
have the cost of real estate and other

1170
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,040
uh costs that Barnes & Noble was

1171
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,319
shouldering and it sunk a lot of money

1172
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:58,119
trying to keep Pace particularly in Nook

1173
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:00,640
it's e-reader business take your story

1174
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,359
wherever you want it to go but nothing

1175
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,480
helped stop the bleeding the company's

1176
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,640
Revenue has declined since

1177
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,960
2012 then in 2019 hedge fund Elliot

1178
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,720
Management Corporation acquired the

1179
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,960
chain and installed James da who led

1180
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,880
British retailer waterstones and founded

1181
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,040
his own independent bookstore da books

1182
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,800
as CEO it felt entirely intuitive to me

1183
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,960
that you allow each bookstore to run as

1184
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,400
an independent bookstore they will

1185
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,280
create much more interesting much more

1186
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,760
Dynamic much more engaging bookstores

1187
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,400
and that meant reminding people about

1188
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,760
the appeal of inperson versus online

1189
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,000
shopping what you're missing is the

1190
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,280
opportunity to kind of read the book

1191
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,280
flaps of all the other books that are

1192
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,079
there and maybe get recommendations from

1193
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,800
the local book seller who's working

1194
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,880
there the company says it wanted to

1195
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,640
emphasize the experience of visiting a

1196
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,359
physical bookstore so its new strategy

1197
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:54,200
strips stores of the cookie cutter look

1198
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,319
and feel that had helped the change grow

1199
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,640
its revenue and store count some

1200
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,559
locations have moved on from The Big Box

1201
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:02,880
model to smaller stores and in these

1202
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,240
smaller spaces they are reconfiguring

1203
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,760
the stores so that they're more of a

1204
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,480
maze and less of a supermarket aisle

1205
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,559
plus the company says each individual

1206
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:13,800
store has more autonomy over what books

1207
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,520
to order and how to display them here at

1208
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,400
the Pikesville Maryland location the

1209
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,200
store manager says that customers like

1210
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,319
romance books from Black authors and

1211
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,720
lots of fiction so the large romance

1212
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,680
section is at the front of the store and

1213
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,200
there's a huge display right in the

1214
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,640
center celebrating Black History Month

1215
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,480
store managers can also choose how to

1216
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,800
run promotions like this buy one get one

1217
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,280
50% off deal on specific fiction books

1218
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,720
chosen by the team here Brooklyn has a

1219
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,359
very different demographic very

1220
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,319
different set of customers a very

1221
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,640
different set of book interests to let's

1222
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,480
say somebody in Alabama in Georgia who

1223
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,040
is the best person to judge what those

1224
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,079
particular communities want to by it the

1225
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,280
book sellers in those communities the

1226
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,119
company has also been listening to its

1227
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,319
store managers on wider Trends manga was

1228
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:05,160
a small part of our assortment we had

1229
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,920
maybe five six Bays of books on manga

1230
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,559
And yet when these book sellers were

1231
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:11,040
reorganizing their stores they were

1232
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,880
coming back to us saying we want to do

1233
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,920
38 you know we want to do 42 which was

1234
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,200
just almost sort of incomprehensible

1235
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,680
except that's what they said their

1236
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,400
customers would respond to D also used

1237
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,160
this localizing strategy to turn around

1238
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,200
British books store chain water stones

1239
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,359
which reported a 42.9 million pound loss

1240
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:34,480
across 268 stores in 2012 compared to a

1241
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,160
16.32 million pound profit across 278

1242
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,319
stores 6 years later the two businesses

1243
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:44,960
are on paper identical it had had

1244
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,599
identical histories um and had reached

1245
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,720
an identical point of failure that's why

1246
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,640
Barnes & Noble relinquished some control

1247
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,160
to individual stores but that comes with

1248
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,680
its own set of of challenges for the

1249
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,079
company you could walk into a bookstore

1250
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,640
and find out that it's really not doing

1251
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,680
well the manager's choices aren't

1252
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,319
appealing to customers and books aren't

1253
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,280
selling still Barnes & Noble says the

1254
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,599
strategy is promising for the first time

1255
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:10,400
in more than a decade the company is

1256
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,440
planning on opening more stores than it

1257
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,680
closes in

1258
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,280
2023 we've seen a balancing in which

1259
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,680
much higher percentage of our sales are

1260
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,559
coming from books and books are growing

1261
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:21,640
really very dramatically if you run

1262
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,640
better bookstores you sell more books
