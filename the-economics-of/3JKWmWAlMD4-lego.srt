1263
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,160
this is what Lego products looked like

1264
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,400
in the

1265
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:33,000
1980s and this is a Lego Product

1266
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,280
now that's because the company has

1267
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,800
become more than just blocks they have

1268
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,760
video games movies theme parks all these

1269
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,040
activities which ultimately reinforce

1270
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,800
the core which is the sale of Lego sets

1271
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,480
all that content helped it become the

1272
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,880
world's largest toy maker breaking in

1273
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,280
billions of dollars every year here's

1274
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,480
how the company uses licensing deals in

1275
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,280
media to expand it its customer base and

1276
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,000
build its content Empire this is the

1277
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,760
economics of Lego Lego is 90 years old

1278
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,440
it was founded in Denmark in 1932 and

1279
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,760
initially it was a company that made

1280
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,799
wooden toys but then in the 1950s it

1281
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:13,799
launched its trademark product the one

1282
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:15,960
we all know now the the plastic Lego

1283
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,559
brick since then Lego has beat out

1284
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,599
Hasbro and metel to become the biggest

1285
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:23,160
toy brand worldwide in the first 6

1286
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,680
months of 2022 the company's Revenue h

1287
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,280
27 billion Danish croner or about $ 3.47

1288
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,160
billion up 177% from 2021 and it's

1289
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,760
anticipating growing demand so much so

1290
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,280
that the company is building two new

1291
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,680
factories in the US and Vietnam Lego has

1292
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,319
made the bricks the building blocks of

1293
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:44,119
its business Lego is still essentially a

1294
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,960
toy company what what they always say is

1295
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,480
their core is still to make the plastic

1296
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,520
bricks for kids but of course they do

1297
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,440
now do a lot more than that some of

1298
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,799
LEGO's first moves into content started

1299
00:49:54,799 --> 00:49:57,880
in the 199 90s Island behind us when the

1300
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,400
company's sales slumped it was trying

1301
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,079
everything from new toys to electronics

1302
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:06,280
to theme parks can you find the power

1303
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,920
Bionicle Bionicle came along in the

1304
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,359
early 2000s and that was a time when the

1305
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,799
LEGO brand was actually in danger of

1306
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:14,920
becoming a little bit stale the bionical

1307
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,559
franchise featured buildable action

1308
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,200
figures and multiplatform storytelling

1309
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,400
agile determined Unstoppable the

1310
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
franchise built a Content Universe

1311
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,680
through Comics books movies and video

1312
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,000
games the BET proved successful in 2003

1313
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,599
when the toy maker saw a 26% loss in net

1314
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:35,839
sales Bionicle was its bestselling line

1315
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,160
and it really revitalized the brand and

1316
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,559
and showed them a way that they could

1317
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:42,880
engage audiences with different types of

1318
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,079
content with cartoons

1319
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,359
movies comics and it wasn't just

1320
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,799
Original Stories Lego released its first

1321
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:52,280
sets based off of licensed material in

1322
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,720
1999 Star Wars in 2005 it it brought

1323
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,760
that into content with a 5-minute short

1324
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,680
called revenge of the brick that aired

1325
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,760
on Cartoon

1326
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,079
Network it was a Twist of course on the

1327
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,079
Revenge of the Sith which was the the

1328
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,599
Star Wars movie which came out at the

1329
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,799
time that really paved the way for the

1330
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:11,480
for the content Partnerships which we've

1331
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,280
seen in subsequent years that Lego twist

1332
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,160
has since been put to use on all sorts

1333
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,720
of franchises like Batman Marvel and

1334
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,079
Jurassic world really we're now used to

1335
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:23,359
seeing not just the basic Lego kits but

1336
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,680
Lego Star Wars kits and and so on that's

1337
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,599
really an integral part of what Lego

1338
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,400
does now so it's really the content has

1339
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,760
has changed Lego's identity we think of

1340
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,760
it as part of these popular franchises

1341
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,839
which we all know like Marvel and

1342
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,040
licensed material was on full display on

1343
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,119
the company's Smash Hit 2014's The Lego

1344
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,240
Movie which grossed over $450 million

1345
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,760
worldwide it held the top spot in the US

1346
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,480
box office for 3 weeks after its release

1347
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,280
Superman Wonder Woman the mermaid

1348
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,359
Michelangelo and the 2002 NBA allar the

1349
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,359
goal of the Lego movie was to Market

1350
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,319
Lego to a wider audience I think it was

1351
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,680
a lot more successful than anyone

1352
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,960
imagined it was a very successful movie

1353
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,799
in its own right a big hit at the box

1354
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:09,839
office that laid the template for for a

1355
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,240
lot of the content creation that Lego

1356
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,000
has done since then Lego and Warner

1357
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,839
Brothers released three more feature

1358
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:18,280
films the latest in 2019 none earned as

1359
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,640
much as the first of course there is a

1360
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,920
risk of oversaturation Lego doesn't want

1361
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,599
to do too much but but I think think

1362
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,319
they're still very much at the stage of

1363
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:29,520
growing in a lot of markets content has

1364
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,280
helped the toy maker break into new

1365
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,520
places like China where Lego is growing

1366
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,040
its presence of the 66 new stores it

1367
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,079
opened in the first half of 2022 46 of

1368
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:41,680
those were in China almost 42% of the

1369
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,839
company's 833 locations are there movies

1370
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:46,880
and games assist in raising awareness of

1371
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,520
the brand the main challenge Lego faced

1372
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,160
in in New Markets like China is that the

1373
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,079
grown-ups the parents just don't really

1374
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:54,760
know about Lego they don't have Lego in

1375
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,440
their in their own backgrounds like a

1376
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,680
lot of grown-ups in in the US and Europe

1377
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,960
do and using licensed material in that

1378
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,480
content also helps reach more audiences

1379
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,760
being part of these popular franchises

1380
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,640
like The Avengers for example is a great

1381
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,960
way for Lego to to reach out to all

1382
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,640
kinds of different Generations people

1383
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,520
across the world people who don't

1384
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,760
necessarily even know Lego content is

1385
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,799
also a way for it to appeal to its adult

1386
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:22,960
fans as the brand has been trying to do

1387
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,760
in recent years find your flow

1388
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,559
build with Lego bricks reality TV show

1389
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,839
Lego Masters for example features adults

1390
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:33,079
building extreme Creations out of the

1391
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:36,119
titular plastic bricks the original Lego

1392
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,160
fans took to Lego as kids and they're

1393
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,359
now grown up and and a lot of those

1394
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:42,400
people are still very keen on Lego and I

1395
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,599
think Lego very smartly realized that a

1396
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:47,079
lot of those people would be willing to

1397
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:49,839
to buy kits that are are pretty complex

1398
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,280
pretty expensive and are designed

1399
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,119
specifically for for grown-ups the

1400
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,839
company has its eyes set Beyond just the

1401
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,559
$2 dimensional screen last April Lego

1402
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,400
and epic games announced a partnership

1403
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,160
to build a digital experience in the

1404
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,400
metaverse all of this content certainly

1405
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,240
in the company's current thinking the

1406
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,920
movies the games that all is there to

1407
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,280
support the core product which is the

1408
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,000
same as it has been for decades the

1409
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,880
plastic brick
