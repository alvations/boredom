112
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,880
Joe's </s> let's say you wanted to buy this

113
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,039
Primark t-shirt if you're shopping on

114
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:00,280
primark's website you'll quick discover

115
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,639
that you

116
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,520
can't over the past 10 years e-commerce

117
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,840
sales have more than doubled but last

118
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,199
year European fast fashion retailer

119
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,880
Primark made 9.5 billion in sales

120
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,600
revenue without a single penny from

121
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,840
online shopping we made a very clear

122
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,960
choice and our Clear Choice is bricks

123
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,479
and mortar this comes at an uncertain

124
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,880
time for struggling clothing retailers

125
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,800
retailers like Forever 21 JC Penney and

126
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,000
Neiman Marcus have closed stores and

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,639
filed for bankruptcy and while a UBS

128
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,199
report shows up to 880,000 retail stores

129
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,960
will close in the next 5 years Primark

130
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,600
plans to expand to 60 stores in the same

131
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,400
time frame is driving 2 hours from

132
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
Toronto to Buffalo to shop at Primark

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,440
worth it heck yes I used to fly 6 hours

134
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,960
to do so so how is primar expanding

135
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,520
without online shopping this is the

136
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,840
economics of Primark fashion retailer is

137
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,280
is incredibly competitive more so than

138
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,199
ever there's not many players especially

139
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,160
in fast fashion that are making

140
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,080
fat margins pretty much the thinking

141
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,720
everywhere is that you have to have this

142
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,240
online presence but online shopping is

143
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,199
actually incredibly expensive for

144
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,520
retailers you have to have a logistical

145
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,639
hub from which you would dispatch the

146
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,880
goods and then You' probably have a

147
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,759
local distribution center from which you

148
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,840
have to do last mile delivery each step

149
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,560
of that just is an extra layer of cost

150
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,440
that just eats away at the margin which

151
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,280
in fashion is very very slim anyway but

152
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,440
the real killer for e-commerce is that

153
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,039
somebody who buys something on the

154
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,000
Internet is far more likely to return

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,280
that product than somebody who goes into

156
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,680
a store returns are one of the biggest

157
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,240
profit losses for online retailers on

158
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,919
average processing a return for $100

159
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,039
worth of merchandise bought online costs

160
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,120
a company $ 2650 for years online

161
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,919
retailers just ate these expenses only

162
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,919
now are more of them deciding to pass

163
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,319
the cost back to the consumer Primark

164
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,000
have just said right from the beginning

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,759
we don't think we can make money out of

166
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,479
e-commerce we're not even going to going

167
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:00,879
to try we're going to focus all our

168
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,840
resources on the physical store and

169
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,120
protect our margins and that wasn't an

170
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,280
issue for the retailer until now Primark

171
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,720
is expected to close all 189 of its UK

172
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,879
stores tonight and it doesn't have an

173
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,879
online offering to fall back on

174
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,919
e-commerce was a Lifeline for a lot of

175
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,120
retailers during the pandemic they

176
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,639
couldn't open their stores but they were

177
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,840
still able to make some sales on the

178
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,280
internet but Primark didn't budge even

179
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,919
as consumers urged for it to offer

180
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,479
online shopping and even after its

181
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,400
Revenue dropped by almost 22 billion and

182
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,240
I think their confidence in this model

183
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,639
of having no digital sales and only

184
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,039
using stores I think was probably shaken

185
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,160
by the pandemic who knows what would

186
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
have happened if it had gone on for

187
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,479
longer I think the closures weren't

188
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,120
quite long enough to really tip the

189
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,479
scales and force them to fundamentally

190
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,319
rethink the model instead of traditional

191
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,319
online shopping in 2022 Primark launched

192
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,440
a trial service called click and collect

193
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,520
in select UK stores customers can select

194
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,400
certain products online then pick up

195
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,919
their orders in store so Primark still

196
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,039
has some cost to maintain its website

197
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:07,680
but it's cheaper than running a true

198
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,080
online shop so Primark makes a sale but

199
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,840
they don't have any of the logistical

200
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,039
costs that would be involved in packing

201
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,159
it up and then shipping it out to your

202
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,199
home and there's another bonus for

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,280
Primark since the customer has to go

204
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,080
inside to collect their purchase they're

205
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,360
likely to browse around and maybe even

206
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,240
buy more they make the sale online but

207
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
then they have a good chance of making

208
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
some extra sales when that person visits

209
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,519
them consumer psychologists call this

210
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,799
shopping momentum essentially once

211
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,120
you've already decided to make a

212
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,320
purchase it's easier to justify adding

213
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,880
more to your cart it always feels just

214
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,279
overwhelmingly busy with people who are

215
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,160
in there looking for bargains and it's

216
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,880
not just clothing Primark lures

217
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,240
consumers with beauty home and travel

218
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,640
products similar to a department store

219
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,200
what we like to say about primar here in

220
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,320
the US is that you know we're all

221
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,120
treasure without the hunt so customers

222
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,399
may go in for a new t-shirt and leave

223
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,519
with a suitcase but a Primark that I can

224
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,399
drive to and don't have to fly to is a

225
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,920
dream because that means there's no

226
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,560
limit to what I can buy and bring home

227
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,720
to carry this vast selection of items

228
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,200
Primark finds large retail spaces

229
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,839
because it relies on selling a lot it's

230
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,640
one of the largest retailers in the UK

231
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,519
by volume and one of the largest across

232
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,880
all of Europe last year Primark made

233
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,760
about 9.5 billion in sales revenue in

234
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,079
part by selling a lot of things at low

235
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,279
profit margins and it does this by

236
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,880
sourcing a lot of its clothing from Asia

237
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,680
combined with not offering online

238
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,880
shopping this enables primar to sell its

239
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,040
merchandise at lower prices even lower

240
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,440
than many other fast fashioned retailers

241
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,200
where they do have serious rivals on

242
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,640
Price is with the digital only players

243
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,480
like shien for example they are often

244
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,360
even cheaper than Primark but according

245
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,120
to the National Retail Federation 80% of

246
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,399
shopping still happens in store giving

247
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,360
Primark an edge over its digital only

248
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,440
competitors even so its instore shopping

249
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,160
model got off to a rocky start in the US

250
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,360
Primark opened its first Us store in

251
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,320
Boston back in 2015 although it was

252
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,680
already popular in the UK its us

253
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,519
expansion started slowly over 4 years it

254
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,920
opened nine stores after years of

255
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,959
experimentation primar learned it would

256
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,360
have to change to succeed in the us when

257
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,519
we first opened we took a similar store

258
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,200
size that we would have had in Europe

259
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,640
but when Primark opened its stores

260
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
across the Northeast it struggled to

261
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,519
find the right store density what they

262
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:33,000
found in the US is that retail is so

263
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,160
much more competitive there's a lot more

264
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,360
retail in

265
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,800
downtown areas in the US and than there

266
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,839
is in the UK for example so you just

267
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,760
can't support a massive store it's just

268
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,800
not possible to get enough revenue for

269
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
the size to support its large stor sizes

270
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
it needed a lot of foot traffic but

271
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
unlike the UK stores which were located

272
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,440
in constantly busy areas Us stores were

273
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,079
mostly in malls where during the week

274
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,959
foot traffic dwindled we learned that

275
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,279
actually 35,000 ft of retail selling

276
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,320
space is is actually the The Sweet Spot

277
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,440
for us they didn't face the commercial

278
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,959
pressure that a a publicly owned company

279
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,320
might have faced to suddenly open a 100

280
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,079
stores and and get really big ready

281
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,800
quickly and then possibly risk disaster

282
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,160
because they hadn't thought it through

283
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,000
the culture of primarch has always been

284
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,040
to take our time and and to test and

285
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
learn and we've done that in every

286
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,160
country where we've introduced the brand

287
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,200
this wasn't about you know growing

288
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
market share at all costs and the

289
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,440
overall retail Market is Shifting online

290
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,720
shopping hit a peak during Co but now

291
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,680
growth is beginning to slow as people

292
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,600
return to stores and I think that's

293
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,240
never been so important as it is since

294
