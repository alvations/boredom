979
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,520
this is what

980
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,160
Nintendo originally was yes it was a

981
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,680
playing card company and this is

982
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,359
Nintendo today me Mario consoles theme

983
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,960
parks even movies so what has driven the

984
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,920
$44 billion Empire this is the economics

985
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
of

986
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,839
Nintendo Nintendo is different from its

987
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,720
competitors Sony and Microsoft thanks in

988
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,960
part to its lowcost Hardware Microsoft's

989
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,040
Xbox makes no profit on its Hardware

990
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,359
consoles are actually sold at a loss in

991
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,960
the market so when somebody goes and

992
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,839
they buy an Xbox at their local retailer

993
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,560
uh we're subsidizing that purchase

994
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,720
somewhere between $1 and $200 with the

995
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,280
expectation that we will recoup that

996
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,400
investment over time through accessory

997
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,720
sales and storefront and Sony only

998
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,520
recently began to make a profit on the

999
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,440
PlayStation 5 then there's Nintendo

1000
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,000
their technology is usually five or six

1001
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,480
years behind in terms of

1002
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,560
state-of-the-art but that means that

1003
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,640
they're cheaper to produce and that

1004
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,400
means Nintendo is much much more

1005
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,680
profitable on their Hardware business

1006
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,440
about half of Nintendo's profit in 2022

1007
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,400
came from Hardware Sales they've

1008
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,000
dominated the market when it comes to

1009
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,920
handheld consoles one of its big

1010
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,280
successes the Game Boy launched in

1011
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,200
1989 Nintendo was really early to the

1012
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,319
party uh with handheld they're kind of

1013
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,119
credited with inventing the console

1014
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,400
although they were probably third or

1015
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,599
fourth the game boy had a longer battery

1016
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,280
life compared to some of its competitors

1017
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,760
for four Shades of Gray nuanced gameplay

1018
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,960
and had Tetris one of the top selling

1019
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,359
video games of all time eventually

1020
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,119
Nintendo's Game Boy became the third

1021
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,960
most sold console in the company's

1022
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,839
history selling 119 million units to

1023
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,480
date the company continued to innovate

1024
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
releasing new hardware for its games

1025
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,560
from the GameCube Nintendo DS the wiii

1026
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,480
and to its most recent success the

1027
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,359
switch with more than 122 million units

1028
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,319
sold you can play it at home like a

1029
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,040
console on your big screen TV but you

1030
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,520
could pick it up and take it on the go

1031
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,960
and it becomes a handheld device and

1032
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,319
that's pretty novel we haven't really

1033
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:33,319
seen anything that's a hybrid like that

1034
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:35,599
before sales of the switch device and

1035
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,359
its games accounted for about 94% of

1036
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,760
Nintendo sales revenue in its 2021

1037
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,240
fiscal year and today it's the second

1038
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
bestselling game console in Nintendo's

1039
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,359
history and continues to be a driving

1040
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,599
factor of its Revenue the success of

1041
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,079
Nintendo's consoles is also due to its

1042
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,680
software in other words its games in

1043
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,720
2022 Nintendo had had 19 first party

1044
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,079
titles that sold over a million units

1045
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,839
each exclusive to its consoles the

1046
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:04,960
difference between the others and

1047
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,200
Nintendo is that Nintendo historically

1048
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,400
has produced about 50% of all the games

1049
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,359
sold on its Hardware system and the

1050
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:16,960
other guys are typically under 10% of

1051
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,160
the game sold on their systems so they

1052
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,119
make a small fraction of the software

1053
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,920
that's played on PlayStation and Xbox

1054
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,680
Nintendo makes more than half recent

1055
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,480
Point Animal Crossing New Horizon's

1056
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,880
release in April 2020 created higher

1057
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,480
demand for the only console carrying it

1058
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,319
the switch Nintendo makes games

1059
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:36,839
exclusively for the most part for its

1060
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,800
own devices if you want to play a

1061
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,160
Nintendo game like Legend of Zelda you

1062
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,520
need Nintendo Hardware in fact

1063
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,440
Nintendo's first party games generate

1064
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,240
over 70% of its sales its best sellers

1065
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,880
in 2022 were all Nintendo first party

1066
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,240
games and the type of content Nintendo

1067
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,040
makes is also different than its

1068
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
competitors let's keep in mind

1069
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,680
Nintendo's characters are very

1070
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,200
cute

1071
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,560
Mario Nintendo is known for making

1072
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,480
familyfriendly games for the most part

1073
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,880
so it appeals to a different crowd than

1074
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,640
some of the other Publishers you won't

1075
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,280
see blood or Gore or foul language but

1076
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,160
even Nintendo couple years ago dabbled

1077
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,839
into the shooter genre when we think of

1078
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,079
Shooters right we think of Call of Duty

1079
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,000
fortnite uh they take a very

1080
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,160
familyfriendly approach with Splatoon

1081
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,359
it's a shooter but you're shooting

1082
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:24,680
paintballs the company's next iteration

1083
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,520
bringing these familyfriendly characters

1084
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,560
to a larger Arena and building another

1085
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,800
generation of fans in February 2023

1086
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,000
Nintendo opened its first theme park

1087
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,280
outside of Japan and in April it's

1088
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,480
releasing a Super Mario Brothers movie

1089
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,880
starring Chris Pratt it's a me a Mario

1090
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,920
that's smart because that's going to

1091
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,280
expose the Nintendo brand to hundreds of

1092
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,800
millions of people who haven't ever

1093
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,880
owned a switch I don't think that

1094
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,160
Nintendo is necessarily worried about

1095
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,560
whether somebody who goes to the theme

1096
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,000
park will buy buy a Nintendo console or

1097
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,240
buy a game but they want those people to

1098
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,599
be aware of the Nintendo Brands and they

1099
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,400
want them to know who Mario is and who

1100
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,280
Zelda is and who Yoshi is and who Pikman

1101
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,800
is it is risky to start a new franchise

1102
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,560
and sometimes new properties just don't

1103
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,280
resonate um but they have plenty a very

1104
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,520
deep library and they've stuck with that

1105
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,280
for the most part and iterated on it and

1106
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,960
modernized it we'll probably be playing

1107
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,599
Legends of Zelda for another 20 30 years

1108
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,240
Mario is probably not going anywhere you

1109
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,319
now he's just going to live forever and

1110
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,160
keep that mustache and keep everyone

1111
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,280
happy for many years to come
