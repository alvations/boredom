1409
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,880
your last pizza probably

1410
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,880
came in a box like this it's cardboard

1411
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,359
stur and most importantly keeps your

1412
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,839
cheese from getting stuck to the lid and

1413
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,000
that's thanks to Domino's whose founder

1414
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,720
is widely credited with creating the

1415
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,200
corrugated pizza box it's just one of

1416
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,119
the company's Innovations not in pizza

1417
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,119
but in

1418
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:38,240
delivery in 2022 more than 40% of online

1419
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,400
delivery orders for major pizza chains

1420
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,760
were from dominoes here's how the

1421
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,440
company made its name in the pizza

1422
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,359
delivery market and why this

1423
00:54:46,359 --> 00:54:48,359
foundational piece of its business is

1424
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:51,040
facing new challenges this is the

1425
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,359
economics of

1426
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,440
Domino's Domino's it's a

1427
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,240
Del dominoes originally called Dominics

1428
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,040
acquired its first restaurant in 1960 in

1429
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,520
ipsilanti Michigan and jumped into the

1430
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,559
delivery business the same year

1431
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:09,240
something very few restaurants were

1432
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,559
doing at the time you're now we think of

1433
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,240
delivery as being so ubiquitous I mean

1434
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,760
so many types of restaurants have

1435
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,520
delivery But Domino's was there very

1436
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,000
early at scale one reason it's become so

1437
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,720
well known for its delivery is a

1438
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,760
campaign the company started in the 80s

1439
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,039
PR ing delivery in less than 30 minutes

1440
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:30,240
within 30 minutes only Domino's Pizza

1441
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,319
delivers in 30 minutes or less people

1442
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,079
really did have the sense that once they

1443
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,640
ordered that pizza they were going to

1444
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,400
get it to their homes quickly and I

1445
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,599
think that really helped for marketing

1446
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,440
Domino's ended that guarantee in 1993

1447
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,359
after a delivery driver struck another

1448
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:47,440
vehicle resulting in a lawsuit but by

1449
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,520
then the company had cemented its place

1450
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,839
in delivery and in the half century

1451
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,160
since Domino's was founded it's paid off

1452
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,079
it took the biggest slice of pizza chain

1453
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:58,599
sales in

1454
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,119
2022 Domino's success is due in part to

1455
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:03,880
creativity and every step of its

1456
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,359
delivery process starting with stores

1457
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,880
many are small and often with little or

1458
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,400
no dining space a model the company has

1459
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,640
said allowed for lower rents and reduced

1460
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,720
store expenses over the years Domino's

1461
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,559
has also focused on establishing more

1462
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:22,760
than 6,500 locations in the US and has

1463
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,640
worked with franchisees to extend their

1464
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,760
reach

1465
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,160
so one part of Domino's strategy is

1466
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,400
what's called Fortress which is making

1467
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,720
sure there's enough pizza shops in a

1468
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,160
certain mile radius that wherever your

1469
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,440
order goes one of those pizza shops can

1470
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,720
handle it and it can help get it to your

1471
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,960
house quickly the company's supply line

1472
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,640
is also structured to make the pizza

1473
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,280
creation process as quick and uniform as

1474
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,799
possible Domino's has 25 supply chain

1475
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:52,200
centers in the US where dough is mixed

1476
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,280
and toppings are prepared before being

1477
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,880
sold to to franchise stores where pizzas

1478
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,400
are assembled and baked the more pizzas

1479
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,319
that are sold the more money Domino's

1480
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:03,760
makes from its supply chain it made up

1481
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,520
59% of Domino's Revenue in

1482
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,000
2021 the next part of the process is

1483
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,160
ordering in 2008 the company rolled out

1484
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,520
its Advanced online ordering system

1485
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,240
which included a customized Pizza

1486
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,640
Builder and the Pizza Tracker so the

1487
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,720
Pizza Tracker is something that Domino's

1488
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,520
invented they will let you know where it

1489
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,359
is in the process it's whether it's

1490
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,119
being cooked whether it's out for

1491
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,400
delivery where they're approaching

1492
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,559
Domino's has continued to introduce new

1493
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:34,119
ordering options Pizza Emoji sent

1494
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:36,640
Domino's ordered smiley face then

1495
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,680
there's the last step of the process

1496
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,480
getting the pizza from the kitchen to

1497
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,799
your home from working with special

1498
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,280
kinds of insulated bags to creating 3D

1499
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,760
car top signs Domino's has been a big

1500
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,319
innovator in this step the company has

1501
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,200
experimented with several methods of

1502
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,359
delivery vehicles helicopters electric

1503
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:58,280
bikes self-driving cars even cars with a

1504
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,920
heated Pizza Oven it's really putting

1505
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,359
the whole brand behind delivery in a lot

1506
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,359
of ways but after years at the top of

1507
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,799
delivery Domino's is facing new

1508
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:10,240
challenges companies like Uber Eats

1509
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,760
GrubHub and door Dash are eating at

1510
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,200
Domino's business in the US as drivers

1511
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,520
leave pizza for apps with more flexible

1512
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,640
hours it's contributed to an

1513
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,440
industrywide delivery driver shortage

1514
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,440
other chains like Papa John's and Pizza

1515
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,480
Hut have both started working with some

1516
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,400
of these apps but Domino's has resisted

1517
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,400
they argue that that makes it more

1518
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,960
profitable because you're not having to

1519
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,280
pay an outside service to deliver that

1520
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,640
pizza and to Market that pizza on their

1521
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,760
app and it keeps them closer to their

1522
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,119
customers as the company has faced these

1523
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,079
issues its shares have slumped from a

1524
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:46,720
high at the end of

1525
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,680
2021 now Domino's is exploring new

1526
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,880
options the company is building out a

1527
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,920
fleet of electric delivery vehicles to

1528
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,880
recruit new drivers ERS and it's now

1529
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,119

1532
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,000
cheaper for them if their customers pick

up their own pizza and so they are

1534
