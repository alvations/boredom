# Transcript on YouTube, I want.

Sometimes I let the "The Economics of ..." series from WSJ on youtube play on for hours.

And when I thought, ah ha, I could do some "corpus linguistics" on the subtitles/transcript of the videos per business discussed in the video!


## But the data from YouTube auto-captioning is just horrible...

To be fair, the auto-caption was meant for users to quickly read the close-caption as an accessibility feature, it wasn't a feature created to generate parseable/readable text that one would use for text NLP.
