00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,460
navigated a changing economic climate

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,740
our first story is about America's

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,119
favorite chicken fast food company

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,939
Chick-fil-A a business based on a secret

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,359
recipe

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,279
this is the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,260
which according to multiple industry

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,779
surveys is America's favorite fast food

14
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,239
visit a Chick-fil-A anywhere in the

15
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:34,860
United States and you're likely to see a

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,960
long line of customers patiently waiting

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,760
to order the restaurant's Flagship menu

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,980

your day in part thanks to its famous

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,500
chicken today Chick-fil-A is the third

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,899
largest U.S restaurant chain by domestic

23
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,059
sales we're still seeing tremendous

24
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,800
growth in our business so far this year

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,440
we're up about 20 percent so how did

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,239
this private atlanta-based fast food

27
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,739
chain become one of the most popular

28
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,559
restaurants in America

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,600
this is the economics of Chick-fil-A

30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,040
Chick-fil-A has long had a unique

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,479
approach to business that the company

32
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,000
credits with its success from the

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,680
beginning Chick-fil-A's business was

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
built on a recipe after testing hundreds

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,360
of methods restaurateur Truett Kathy

36
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,340
developed a faster way to cook boneless

37
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,500
chicken using a pressure cooker and

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,140
peanut oil it's perfect and so we've

39
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,880
kept that locked away in a vault and

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,439
we'll continue to use that same recipe

41
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,140
none of the employees have access to it

42
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,240
so it is still shrouded in a lot of

43
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,220
mystery there are recipe sites where you

44
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,259
can try to recreate it but they have

45
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,360
never put it out officially the original

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,079
chicken sandwich is the same today as in

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,119
1967. a breaded breast of chicken two

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,220
pickles both placed on a buttered

49
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,850
Toasted Bun

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:55,579
[Music]

51
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:58,619
Chick-fil-A has long taken Pride for its

52
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,240
commitment to selling high quality

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,420
product in fact Chick-fil-A's name is a

54
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,520
take on chicken filet with a capital A

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,399
at the end symbolizing top quality while

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,318
other fast food chains tend to expand

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,060
their menu offerings over time to

58
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,800
attract new customers Chick-fil-A's

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,180
business model has always been to

60
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,280
maintain a small menu focused on chicken

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,500
sandwiches they like to say it's simple

62
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,400
so they want to keep customers knowing

63
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,800
what's on that menu to be able to easily

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,660
decipher what they want we think about

65
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,340
the way that we serve guests that

66
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,080
consistency is really important that we

67
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,200
get hot sandwiches cold salads and just

68
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,420
tasty products customers seem to agree

69
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,360
since its Creation in 2015 the American

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
customer satisfaction index has been

71
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,560
dominated by Chick-fil-A Chick-fil-A

72
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,080
often rates very high even though the

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,459
service and the drive-through can be

74
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,620
slower people are very happy with the

75
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,180
quality of the service they get in

76
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,519
general today many Chick-fil-A

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,200
restaurants use a practice known as

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,060
Upstream ordering where an associate

79
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,680
will take a customer's order while

80
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,540
they're still waiting in line to start

81
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,220
before the the pandemic but has really

82
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,200
proved very important to the pandemic

83
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,300
when they closed their dining rooms

84
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,760
which really meant the drive-through is

85
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,920
the major channel of sales so if you go

86
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,080
to a Chick-fil-A now in many locations

87
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,480
you will see workers out in the

88
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,239
drive-through with tablets and so

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,980
instead of speaking into a speaker box

90
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,780
and kind of mumbling your order and it

91
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,400
may be getting screwed up you're telling

92
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,560
this person directly next to your car or

93
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,019
what you want to ensure that quality in

94
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,700
every one of its locations Chick-fil-A

95
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,920
uses a different franchise model than

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
most other fast food chains unlike most

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,720
chains where the franchisee covers most

98
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,220
of the costs of opening the restaurant

99
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,319
Chick-fil-A owns every one of its

100
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,659
locations the company also selects the

101
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,239
locations and builds the restaurants we

102
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,500
really think that that's a key

103
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,239
differentiator in the way that we

104
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,280
operate we're not looking for a

105
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,200
financial investor or people that want

106
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,940
to buy a big market and open a bunch of

107
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,739
stores Chick-fil-A States on their

108
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,720
website franchising is not an

109
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,040
opportunity for Passive Financial

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,780
investment working from the sideline

111
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,760
lines or adding to a portfolio of

112
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,980
business ventures franchisees are called

113
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,959
operators and each operator is

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,760
hand-picked by Chick-fil-A after a

115
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,860
rigorous interview process Chick-fil-A

116
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,159
likes to say it's about like going to

117
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,040
Harvard MBA it can take anywhere from 12

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,798
months 24 months so you really have to

119
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,079
want to do this and be willing to go

120
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,600
through the initial paperwork but then

121
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,699
extensive interviews out of the more

122
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,560
than 8 000 applicants Chick-fil-A

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,540
receives annually the company only

124
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,419
selects about 130 new operators a year

125
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,460
that's an acceptance rate lower than

126
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,860
Stanford one of the skills that we

127
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,900
really look for is somebody that's

128
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,820
really good at developing people a lot

129
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,320
of the stores have over 100 employees

130
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,060
they've got to be really really good at

131
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,040
pouring in and developing people in

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
teams and Leadership teams if selected

133
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,540
Chick-Fil-A franchisees need only an

134
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,040
initial investment of ten thousand

135
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,900
dollars which covers the franchise fee

136
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,940
to become an operator that's much lower

137
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,440
than the startup cost for a McDonald's

138
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,199
franchise which requires a 45 five

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,060
thousand dollar franchise fee as well as

140
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,060
1.3 to 2.3 million dollars of additional

141
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,860
investment if they're paid 10 or 15

142
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,740
locations it's hard to have that market

143
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,600
presence and to really know their team

144
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,979
members and the communities that we

145
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,360
serve and we've got a lot of interest to

146
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,100
become operators and feel like that

147
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,540
model is going to be really important

148
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,860
it's what's gotten us to where we are

149
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,540
Chick-fil-A credits this Hands-On

150
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,340
approach with the success of its

151
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,440
restaurants which on average make far

152
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,479
more off of each location than their

153
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,940
competition for years Chick-fil-A's

154
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,560
footprint was mostly in the Southeast

155
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,720
but today they can be found across the

156
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,639
country they have about 2 600

157
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,259
restaurants throughout the country

158
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,259
they're also located in Canada and they

159
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,360
are opening in Puerto Rico we're opening

160
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,759
about 100 stores a year right now and

161
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,199
we've got a lot of growth potential here

162
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,820
just domestically in the United States

163
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,199
but we're also looking at International

164
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,560
as well since 2007 Chick-fil-A has

165
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,160
nearly doubled its restaurant count to

166
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,780
2598. compared to a lot of other chains

167
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,000
that's still slow like a Chipotle is

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,340
opening 200 of restaurants a year no

169
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,900
matter which Chick-fil-A location you

170
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,120
eat at the company says its values are

171
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,180
reflected in its day-to-day operations

172
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,180
very close culture they're also invested

173
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,460
in its values which they do say are

174
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,160
based on judeo-christian values which

175
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,840
you don't have to be a Christian to work

176
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,120
there but they do you know take some of

177
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,180
these basic values of humility and

178
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,759
generosity and and if you want to go to

179
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,199
a prayer service while you're there you

180
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,840
certainly can from its Inception founder

181
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,819
Truett Kathy's Christian faith played a

182
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,080
major role in the company's business

183
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,360
strategy it's why Chick-fil-As are never

184
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,520
open on Sunday not just so workers can

185
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,620
attend church but also so they can rest

186
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,660
in general we feel like we make up for

187
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,220
the sales in the Monday through Saturday

188
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,740
and that anticipation of ah I can't get

189
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,180
Chick-fil-A today so I want to make sure

190
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,220
to go first thing Monday morning it's

191
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,020
also the reason the company has never

192
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,300
gone public I don't think we will ever

193
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,860
actually I know we'll never go public

194
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,080
and there's not a real benefit for us to

195
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,539
do that we've grown conservatively and

196
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,340
so we don't need a lot of investors or

197
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,620
extra cash to go and to build new stores

198
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,380
or new businesses part of Kathy's values

199
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,000
are reflected in how employees are

200
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,680
treated and how they're expected to

201
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,600
treat customers thank you pleasure you

202
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,160
have a great day although you won't see

203
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,720
it in restaurants where the employees

204
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,880
are massed up Chick-fil-A has long asked

205
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,979
employees to greet customers warmly with

206
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,080
a smile even if it's just on a very

207
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,479
small interaction you can share a lot by

208
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,039
just the smile that team member has with

209
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,020
guests is just a small little thing that

210
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,300
we can do that makes a difference

211
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,800
occasionally Chick-fil-A's values have

212
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,020
attracted scrutiny especially when the

213
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,699
company's foundation donates to

214
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,620
conservative groups or causes there's

215
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,599
been some groups perceived as anti-gay

216
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,340
and this is a you know attracted

217
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,099
attention from Progressive groups the

218
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,020
company's foundation in the last year

219
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,880
has focused its charitable giving on

220
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,060
three different areas homelessness

221
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,699
hunger and education I think the most

222
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,259
important thing for us being in the

223
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,180
restaurant business is that we serve

224
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,400
everybody my grandfather I love how he

225
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,080
talked about it with politics he would

226
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,539
say I'm not right wing or left-wing I'm

227
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:04,979
the whole chicken when you go to

228
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,639
headquarters in Atlanta there is this

229
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,460
rock with a quote from Truitt that is

230
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,280
just played prominently that says what

231
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,680
Chick-fil-A's corporate purpose it says

232
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,379
to glorify God by being a faithful

233
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,539
Steward of all that is entrusted to us

234
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,479
to have a positive influence on all who

235
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,879
come in contact with Chick-fil-A I do

236
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,639
think that reflects this very higher

237
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,458
Noble sense of company self they have

238
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,200
they believe they do more than just

239
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,059
serve chicken sandwiches thank you so

240
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,520
much pleasure have a nice one if you've

241
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,620
ever shopped at Costco you may have

242
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,039
noticed that it's a little different

243
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,440
Costco is not engineered for a quick

244
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,480
shopping trip it is exactly the opposite

245
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,620
this is the economics of Costco it's not

246
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,320
a grocery store it's not a small corner

247
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,540
store it's huge it's cavernous the

248
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,060
ceiling is high goods are literally

249
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,279
stacked on pallets up to this almost the

250
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,800
ceiling that's all part of the model and

251
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,680
the experience I gotta cost

252
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,060
okay first thing we got is a five dozen

253
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,620
of eggs then we got salmon for you

254
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,080
unlike most stores there are no aisle

255
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,300
signs or in-store maps to help direct

256
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,620
shoppers

257
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,500
instead aisles are simply numbered

258
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,440
what's more Costco constantly moves some

259
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,019
of its products and Cycles in new

260
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,120
products

261
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,880
so what gives why are Costco's stores

262
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,519
designed this way and how has it helped

263
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,560
the company grow into the retail

264
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,839
Behemoth that it is today

265
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,320
Costco is a big fan of using treasure

266
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,779
hunt retail psychology to draw you in

267
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,480
which is basically having items on the

268
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,480
shelf that are at a like wow price

269
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,459
because they're such a good discount or

270
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,680
they're just really interesting and

271
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,720
they're not going to be there forever

272
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
the big idea behind Costco's treasure

273
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,279
hunt strategy is that by encouraging

274
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,040
customers to explore and ensuring that

275
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,660
there's always a new batch of

276
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,760
interesting deals customers end up

277
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,040
shopping longer and buying more products

278
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,019
today I went to Costco thinking I'm just

279
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,279
going to get a few items but I ended up

280
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,300
with a whole entire

281
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,800
when you go into the store it doesn't

282
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,360
feel the same as the last time you were

283
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,220
there so you have a sense of urgency

284
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,500
about purchasing and also just a sense

285
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,300
of wanting to come back right and check

286
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,560
out what's going on if it was the same

287
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,540
every time you might not come as often

288
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,120
today Costco is one of the world's

289
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,180
largest retailers boasting over 803

290
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,200
locations and 275 000 employees Costco

291
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,300
was part of sort of this early

292
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,240
Warehouse Club concept which was really

293
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,100
about instead of like go to the store

294
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,800
buy a single item come to the store pay

295
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,880
a membership and maybe your small

296
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,160
business and we'll offer you wholesale

297
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,100
prices basically lower prices

298
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,740
most members pay an annual fee of 60 for

299
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,500
the basic plan but customers can upgrade

300
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,600
to the executive membership which is

301
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,000
more perks for 120 dollars a year

302
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,519
membership dues are also how Costco

303
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,519
makes most of its money I think Costco's

304
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,100
Management's main goal is always this

305
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,519
ethos of can we offer more exciting

306
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,560
items at a better price

307
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,160
to keep memberships growing the model is

308
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,560
make money on the membership sell things

309
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,420
as cheaply as possible they can't just

310
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,100
raise the price on something to increase

311
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,140
the profit that's against the internal

312
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,420
code and so that also includes things

313
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,120
like let's save money and how much time

314
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,519
we spend putting products on shelves so

315
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,480
that's part of the reason why you see

316
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,399
these pallets of goods stacked up to the

317
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,200
ceiling is there's not a lot of time

318
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
spent taking apart those pellets putting

319
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,579
each individual product on the Shelf if

320
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,140
they eliminate that there's a little bit

321
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,640
of Labor savings there's some time

322
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,500
savings because they're just putting all

323
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,300
that stuff out on a pallet and you take

324
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,360
it Costco says that an average item in

325
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,459
the store is only marked up 11 percent

326
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,880
compared to the 25 to 50 percent often

327
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,279
seen in retail this commitment to low

328
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,680
prices hasn't just kept customers loyal

329
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,440
it has also helped spread the brand

330
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,940
there's a psychology to finding a deal

331
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,399
that's very satisfying for people and

332
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,920
people enjoy the product selection at

333
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,380
Costco they have very skilled Merchants

334
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,760
that usually have been employed there

335
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,740
for a very long time and really know

336
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,620
what a Costco customer likely would want

337
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,060
and they're good at getting good prices

338
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,680
on those products

339
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,380
I got your protein flavored vanilla and

340
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,779
that sort of creates a certain frenzy

341
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,180
around finding those things I got the

342
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,519
Kirkland brand microwave popcorn I got

343
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,100
two packs of bottled water most

344
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,800
retailers might assume the Shoppers want

345
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,040
more choices not less they sell a

346
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,839
limited number of items so that means

347
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,339
they have to be pretty precise they

348
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,560
think about like giving space to a

349
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,600
product in their store differently than

350
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,420
a Walmart would and if that product

351
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,459
doesn't sell like it's out of there it's

352
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,139
very Cutthroat if you're a product on

353
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,240
the Shelf you have to earn your place

354
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,760
the average Costco Warehouse stocks

355
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,459
about 3 700 products at any given time

356
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,339
less than one tenth of most supermarkets

357
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,639
40 to 50 000 items but even though

358
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,220
Costco stocks fewer items the items they

359
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,339
do stock have a reputation I see you've

360
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,019
noticed me rolling up the sleeves on my

361
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,899
new Kirkland Signature quarters that my

362
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,180
mother got me for the holidays Kirkland

363
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,339
is Costco's you know private label brand

364
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,260
it's their store brand it's a brand that

365
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,060
when they want to offer something at a

366
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,800
certain price that they don't feel uh

367
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,800
manufacturer A supplier can do it they

368
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,720
build it themselves since it was

369
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,360
launched in 1995 the in-house brand has

370
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,700
built a reputation for quality and low

371
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,060
prices on everyday items today Kirkland

372
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,420
products make up a quarter of Costco's

373
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,060
166 billion dollars in annual sales

374
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,800
but when you talk to customers I think

375
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,779
they generally feel that it doesn't

376
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,180
necessarily need to be fancy because

377
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,240
they've already bought into this Costco

378
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,800
pitch which is this is high quality and

379
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,779
it's a lower price and you don't need to

380
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,959
be afraid of it that Customer Loyalty

381
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,839
helped Costco remain strong during the

382
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,760
pandemic Costco is certainly a model

383
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,220
that has not only survived the pandemic

384
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,639
but has really thrived in the pandemic

385
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,079
despite the increased popularity of

386
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,360
online shopping Costco has leaned into

387
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,820
its strategy of driving members to its

388
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,500
stores it's it's really interesting to

389
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,360
me because for years people have

390
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,100
questioned Costco you know Amazon's

391
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,899
going to get you you got to get bigger

392
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,660
online and that really hasn't played out

393
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,339
yet they've said explicitly we prefer

394
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,600
people to come into the store and Shop

395
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,760
we want impulse buys we want people to

396
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,959
come in and see what we have and buy

397
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,880
more we work better that way and it's

398
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,240
cheaper

399
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,740
[Music]

400
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,360
if you've ever ordered something at

401
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
Starbucks you've probably loaded one of

402
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,980
these Starbucks between October and

403
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,600
December is set something like three

404
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,060
billion dollars of value is loaded onto

405
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,800
these cards I mean that's a lot of money

406
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,199
so much money in fact that if Starbucks

407
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,800
was a bank it would rank as the 385th

408
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,019
biggest in the country and it's money

409
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,060
that Starbucks gets to use up front as

410
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,699
Revenue before a single product is even

411
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,579
purchased eventually it is a liability

412
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,040
if someone chooses to use it and you

413
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,720
will find that in lots of gift card

414
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,519
programs they're planning people who

415
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,980
never use it so how important is

416
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,440
Starbucks's mobile app and gift cards to

417
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,839
its bottom line and what role does

418
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,060
technology play in its continued

419
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,440
evolution

420
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,760
this is the economics of Starbucks

421
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,420
in 1971 the first Starbucks a small

422
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,880
unassuming Cafe opened in Seattle's

423
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,760
downtown fast forward 50 years and that

424
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,500
store is still in operation but

425
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,560
Starbucks is a global coffee giant only

426
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,079
McDonald's is bigger than Starbucks when

427
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,240
it comes to market caps so they are

428
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,880
really a Powerhouse when it comes to

429
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,339
really the whole restaurant industry in

430
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,260
its early years of operation Starbucks

431
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,899
expanded slowly and only within Seattle

432
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,959
it wasn't until 1987 when the original

433
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,000
owners sold the company to its then

434
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,339
marketing director Howard Schultz that

435
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,139
the Starbucks that we know today took

436
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,240
root Schultz began expanding Starbucks

437
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,639
outside of the city and introduced

438
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
Americans to what was then a

439
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,660
little-known Italian drink the espresso

440
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,880
they were really founded on this coffee

441
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,459
house culture that they make each

442
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:27,180
beverage by hand according to order as

443
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,399
Starbucks has grown that has gotten more

444
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,100
complicated today Starbucks says they

445
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,440
make more than 100 170 000 different

446
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,899
varieties of drinks these beverages can

447
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,699
be very complex they can take a while

448
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,740
they can take many different ingredients

449
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,380
and so it's good for Starbucks and that

450
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,540
these tend to be higher priced beverages

451
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,199
but for workers the Baristas they can be

452
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,180
very complicated the company's early

453
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,579
investment in espresso has transformed

454
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,800
to many different signature drinks from

455
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,079
the creation of the Frappuccino to the

456
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,940
launch of the pumpkin spice latte

457
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,020
pumpkin spice latte High private they

458
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,220
really didn't know that it would take

459
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,919
off like it did but clearly it is formed

460
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,740
quite a phenomenon all around the world

461
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,740
really we introduced pumpkin to spice us

462
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,380
here Starbucks one additional thing in

463
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,660
Starbucks evolution is cold beverages

464
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,179
have become much more important to the

465
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,919
company whether it's just an iced coffee

466
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,520
or a Nitro iced coffee or all these cold

467
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,280
foam and cold brewed increasingly this

468
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,440
is so important to their revenue the

469
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,660
company's gone through periods where

470
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,980
Frappuccino sales have softened but

471
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,960
they've come up with more cold drinks to

472
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,340
keep people interested in keep people

473
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,480
ordering

474
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,400
in part due to the company's Seattle

475
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,679
founding technology has played a large

476
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,440
role in the change dominance a key

477
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,419
moment of that was the founding of its

478
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,179
mobile app in 2009 which was very early

479
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,039
for one of these kind of apps and they

480
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,520
really saw this as a digital flywheel at

481
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,100
the end of 2021 mobile orders accounted

482
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,320
for nearly a quarter of all Starbucks

483
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,840
transactions in the U.S many of those

484
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,640
purchased through a virtual Starbucks

485
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,160
gift card which was previously the only

486
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,200
way a customer could order on their

487
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,320
phone today a little under one half or

488
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,600
44 percent of all transactions at

489
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,520
Starbucks are done with a Starbucks card

490
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,039
in fact so many Starbucks customers use

491
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,140
a Starbucks card or the Starbucks mobile

492
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,000
app to purchase items that Starbucks

493
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,940
says it holds about 2.4 billion dollars

494
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,100
in cash that was uploaded by customers

495
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,039
to be used later that number exceeds the

496
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,140
deposits at many American Banks

497
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,600
Starbucks also gets a lot of data from

498
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,240
that they own a lot of that data in a

499
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,760
way that many companies don't because

500
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,620
they have created this whole ecosystem

501
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,780
where people are you know using the

502
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,419
Starbucks app their mobile ordering and

503
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,860
they're hooked into that Starbucks

504
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,440
unique proprietary system as mobile

505
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,780
payments rise Starbucks's business

506
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,360
priorities have shifted prior to the

507
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,240
pandemic approximately 80 percent of U.S

508
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,280
Starbucks transactions were on the go

509
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,160
either as drive-through or mobile order

510
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Starbucks starred in cities but really

511
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,780
has spread all around the country

512
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,539
including suburbs and a lot of that is

513
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,520
through drive-throughs these alternate

514
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,860
pickup options are becoming increasingly

515
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,840
important to the company's bottom line

516
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,059
especially during the pandemic I mean

517
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,160
these stores have been a Lifeline to

518
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,080
Starbucks because they kept running and

519
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,299
people could easily queue up and go and

520
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,179
not have to enter an actual Cafe

521
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:32,220
Starbucks has long said that it remains

522
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,260
committed to a set of values established

523
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,820
early in the company's existence

524
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,220
Starbucks is very

525
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,200
committed to trying to create a

526
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,360
connection between its Baristas and its

527
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,820
customers even in its drive through they

528
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,559
talk about this on earnings calls that

529
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,360
there are these customer connection

530
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,640
scores they want to make sure that

531
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,200
everyone is feeling good about their

532
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,120
Starbucks experience which is getting

533
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,160
increasingly challenging when you're

534
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,720
ordering through a drive-through or a

535
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
mobile app you're trying to get in and

536
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,220
out Starbucks says those values also

537
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,960
appear in the manner in which their

538
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,600
stores are designed the items you will

539
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,100
find in the store they really

540
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,559
choreograph that down to where the

541
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,780
basket of waters is placed into a store

542
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,700
they want this all to feel very similar

543
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,340
Starbucks is long touted its internal

544
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,039
culture which it says is built on a

545
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,720
strong relationship between management

546
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,380
and employees the workers at its stores

547
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,299
are not called workers or Baristas

548
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,640
they're called partners and this is very

549
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,700
Central to the company's ideology part

550
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,220
of that is that all these Partners do

551
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,160
get shares in the company it's called

552
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,740
Beanstalk that relationship may look

553
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,419
different going forward for some

554
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,179
Starbucks locations after two of three

555
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,460
buffalo stores voted in favor of

556
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,039
unionization since then Starbucks has

557
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,200
thrown a huge amount of energy and

558
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,679
resources into this issue and Executives

559
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,100
have traveled to Buffalo extensively to

560
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,600
meet with workers to try to understand

561
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,320
their concerns according to the company

562
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,360
they want to maintain this direct

563
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,220
relationship with their workers they

564
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,740
call unions in intermediary they do not

565
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,799
want that relationship to be severed but

566
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,140
according to these workers they who

567
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,940
support the union they want a more

568
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,919
direct relationship with the company in

569
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,299
a statement to the Wall Street Journal

570
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,539
Starbucks said Starbucks's success past

571
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,059
present and future is built on how we

572
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,460
partner together always with our mission

573
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,740
and values at our core from the

574
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,299
beginning we've been clear in our belief

575
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,220
that we are better together as partners

576
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,320
without a union between us at Starbucks

577
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,460
and that conviction has not changed

578
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,720
they are the world's biggest coffee

579
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,580
chain they are very dominant when it

580
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,740
comes to Coffee sales and they are

581
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,020
really synonymous with coffee house

582
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,360
culture in a lot of ways but they do

583
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,920
face increasing pressures

584
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,020
[Music]

585
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,880
you know they don't tell you don't lay

586
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,960
on the bed

587
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,720
you're supposed to lay on the bed

588
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,419
if you've ever visited an Ikea you've

589
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:04,620
likely encountered their stores

590
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,860
endlessly winding floor plan this layout

591
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,440
can be confusing

592
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,919
that is by Design Ikea may be the

593
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,419
biggest Furniture retailer on the planet

594
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,659
but it's certainly not conventional the

595
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,700
Swedish Furniture giant asks its

596
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,380
customers to build their own products

597
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,720
and its stores and distributes those

598
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,840
products in minimalist flat packed boxes

599
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,020
so how of these retail strategies as

600
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,760
well as their famous Swedish meatballs

601
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,860
contributed to the company's runaway

602
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,539
success this is the economics of Ikea a

603
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:40,679
look at the innovative business

604
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,260
practices that have transformed Modern

605
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,000
Life

606
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,039
when you step into an Ikea you

607
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,860
immediately sort of are put

608
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,419
A's like

609
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,820
path

610
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,940
IKEA store layout is a fixed path design

611
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,919
which means there's a designated road

612
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,320
that all customers must follow that

613
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,760
guides you through the store in One

614
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,140
Direction

615
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,140
it's not a grab a carton of milk and get

616
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,360
out kind of store it's it's the opposite

617
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,159
of that

618
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,860
it's very much set up to spend a day

619
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,159
think about rooms you know dream about

620
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,600
what you really want your bedroom to

621
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,880
look like

622
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,059
a floor plan of most Ikea stores

623
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,919
resembles a maze the curves about every

624
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,559
50 feet to keep customers curious about

625
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,320
what comes next since an average IKEA

626
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,140
store is around 300 000 square feet or

627
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,539
five American football fields that means

628
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,960
a lot of walking an Ikea is to some

629
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,780
frustratingly winding but really it's

630
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,059
laid out as an experience to get you to

631
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,240
buy more

632
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,980
Ikea is famous for putting its customers

633
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,500
to work unlike most Furniture retailers

634
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,080
that sell products pre-assembled many of

635
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,600
Ikea's pieces have to be built by their

636
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,620
customers

637
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,960
but why as many couples and their

638
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,940
therapists well know building your own

639
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,000
IKEA cabinet can be challenging the big

640
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,600
idea behind the Ikea effect is consumers

641
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,880
are more attached to have more positive

642
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,280
feelings towards objects or things that

643
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,559
we've put effort into and that we

644
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,240
actually think that they're more

645
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,559
valuable because of that foreign

646
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:25,440
Ikea effect was first coined in 2011 by

647
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,179
researchers who noticed a similar

648
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,919
phenomena in other products and

649
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,360
businesses

650
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,460
when instant cake mixes were first

651
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,860
introduced in the 1950s they didn't sell

652
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,440
well and then they said let's add a

653
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,600
fresh egg it was this idea that we want

654
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,880
to feel like we're just participating

655
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,100
enough to not feel guilty about taking a

656
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,659
shortcut

657
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,179
when you make a cake from a mix which do

658
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,580
you want a fresh egg cake or a cake made

659
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,159
with dried eggs for higher lighter

660
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,620
tastier cake why fresh eggs of course

661
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,080
the idea that we should love building

662
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,659
products isn't necessarily what Ikea

663
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,280
intended

664
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,559
if you've ever shopped at one of Ikea's

665
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,840
massive warehouse stores you're likely

666
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,760
aware of the unconventional product

667
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,780
names

668
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,000
but what you may not realize is that in

669
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,980
creating these items Ikea sometimes

670
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,320
comes up with a price tag first sort of

671
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,640
a classic example that they could talk

672
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,440
about all the time is the one one dollar

673
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,900
light bulb if they had this idea that a

674
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,120
one dollar LED light bulb you know this

675
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,039
new type of light bulb would be hard to

676
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,360
achieve but if they could achieve it

677
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,220
lots of people would buy LED light bulbs

678
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,679
so they just sort of designed backward

679
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,779
from the prep with the price point in

680
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,600
mind that obsession with low prices is a

681
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,179
large part of why Ikea is the world's

682
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,299
largest Furniture retailer today Ikea

683
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:46,380
has 445 stores operating in 52 countries

684
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,179
you know obviously if you go into a

685
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,620
student dorm room you're going to find a

686
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,600
lot of Ikea but you'll also find some

687
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,659
Ikea products in a wealthy person's home

688
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,580
and that's really what they're going for

689
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,919
today Ikea is the very definition of

690
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,260
mass Market appeal but when the company

691
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,240
first began as a Swedish mail order

692
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,120
business in 1943 well-designed Furniture

693
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,640
tended to be expensive and as a result

694
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,760
Out Of Reach for most were seen as a

695
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,860
serious long-term investment

696
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,320
ingvar comprad who founded the company

697
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,720
as a teenager pushed forward the idea

698
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,179
that furniture could be flat packed to

699
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,980
massively reduce the cost of shipping

700
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,980
and transportation so flat packing is

701
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,820
really the largest arguably Ikea

702
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,860
invention that really led to the

703
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,380
company's growth and the idea is that

704
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,940
instead of buying you know a piece of

705
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,320
furniture all put together it's

706
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,360
deconstructed into a flat pack you can

707
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,159
fit more in a truck you can fit more in

708
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,900
the Ikea warehouse and you can also get

709
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,600
it in your car and the trade-off is you

710
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,640
know you put it together at the end flat

711
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,100
packing is a practical aspect of the

712
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,260
philosophy that has long guided Ikea's

713
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,140
success called Democratic design it's

714
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,580
this idea that everything is in Balance

715
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,220
both price form function the aesthetic

716
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,620
the sustainability this Vision to create

717
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,539
a better everyday life for the many

718
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,059
people was sent forth more than 30 years

719
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:12,000
ago by comprod in a Manifesto now

720
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,400
presented to every Ikea employee and

721
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,520
they talk about it almost religiously

722
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,559
and fundamentally it's this idea that

723
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,059
when designing a product they think

724
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,020
about

725
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,779
it can't just be really cool looking it

726
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,100
can't just be functional it has to be

727
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,080
all those things

728
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,720
so despite the long shopping trips and

729
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,039
the DIY

730
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,200
customers can't seem to get enough of

731
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,460
Ikea

732
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,100
perhaps it's as simple as labor leaves

733
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,520
to love they are so cute and they even

734
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,980
smell like the cereal y'all Crocs the

735
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,779
colorful shoe that first became popular

736
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,080
in the early 2000s hit its peak in 2021

737
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,659
the company reported a record annual

738
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,779
revenue of 2.3 billion dollars in 2021

739
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,299
up over 60 percent from the previous

740
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,360
year and its stock reached record highs

741
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,520
the past few years for Crocs has been

742
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,980
this moment of heavy collaboration

743
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,679
constant releases they're really trying

744
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,720
to put themselves in front of people

745
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,580
that might not have considered a Crocs

746
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,100
prior

747
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,020
the company's success coincided with the

748
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,940
pandemic leading some to credit the

749
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,340
shoe's popularity to timing especially

750
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,080
as its stock price has been dropping

751
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,539
since the pandemic boom has waned but

752
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,460
other comfortable Footwear Brands didn't

753
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,919
take off the way Crocs did so how did

754
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,779
Crocs make a name for itself during the

755
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,240
pandemic and how did it find success as

756
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,419
one of Fashion's most divisive shoes

757
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:39,299
this is the economics of Crocs

758
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,360
the company was founded in 2002 the same

759
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,940
year it debuted its classic clog the

760
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,159
name Crocs was inspired by crocodiles

761
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,039
who live on land and in water when

762
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,480
cracks were first released they were

763
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,400
intended for a consumer that was looking

764
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,900
at them as a functional thing so

765
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,059
probably gardeners people that you know

766
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,220
were on boats people that worked all day

767
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,960
on their feet people that worked on a

768
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,580
line in the kitchen part of what makes

769
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,740
them so functional is the material a

770
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,659
proprietary closed cell resin called

771
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,700
crosslight that's slip resistant

772
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,700
lightweight and easy to clean producing

773
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,980
a molded shoe is certainly simpler in a

774
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,840
lot of ways than assembling a sneaker

775
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,120
the most underrated Advantage they have

776
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,919
over the marketplace is that it's clear

777
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,960
that they're able to kind of do things

778
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,820
that other companies would not be able

779
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,380
to do because of their scale and because

780
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,480
of their production capabilities Crocs

781
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,399
sales took off in the first three

782
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,580
quarters of 2005 it sold 4.4 million

783
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,399
shoes hitting a revenue of 75 million

784
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,360
dollars

785
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,039
part of the reason for its initial

786
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,020
success was that the shoe was easy to

787
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,880
get it was available at retail stores

788
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,960
gift shops and mall kiosks in 2006 Crocs

789
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,059
purchased gibbets a company that made

790
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,460
small plastic shoe charms that same year

791
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,500
the company went public and became the

792
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,840
largest ever U.S footwear IPO at the

793
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,659
time but in 2008 in the midst of the

794
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,820
financial crash the company suffered a

795
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,940
net income loss of 185 million dollars

796
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,399
though the initial crates had simmered

797
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,620
the brand still managed to hang on to a

798
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,600
relatively large customer base over the

799
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,220
next few years thanks to its Global

800
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,279
presence in 2014 Crocs started making

801
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,899
major changes to its business model

802
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,179
closing dozens of stores shifting away

803
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:20,340
from malls and turning to online sellers

804
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,740
like Amazon Crocs announcing today it

805
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,380
will eliminate nearly 200 jobs and close

806
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,360
a number of retail stores as part of a

807
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,399
restructuring effort the company also

808
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,320
cut back on the number of styles it sold

809
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,659
by between 30 and 40 percent and

810
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,880
refocused on the classic clog that made

811
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,840
it famous

812
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,360
the following year Crocs invested in a

813
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,340
Global Marketing push to relaunch its

814
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,880
brand image

815
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,500
despite its efforts the company's stock

816
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,200
held steady until 2020 when the global

817
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,880
pandemic hit prior to people working

818
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,500
from home and you know not wearing their

819
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,880
dress shoes not wearing their heels

820
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,580
there was already this Rising wave of

821
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,740
comfort-minded comfort first Footwear

822
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,020
that was really becoming more popular of

823
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,340
course that accelerated during the

824
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,440
pandemic the Comfort aspect is what many

825
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,720
call the key to crox's success but

826
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,760
another important factor is how easy it

827
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,559
is to customize the shoe with gibbets

828
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,140
you move them to different Crocs over

829
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,480
time as you've got a green pair a camo

830
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,039
pair or a pink pair that like the

831
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,480
gibbets would stay with you and they

832
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,760
were yours they were almost like uh the

833
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,679
way a keychain on a backpack was at a

834
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,080
certain point this idea of individuality

835
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,000
and self-expression is one that the

836
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,860
brand emphasizes through its marketing

837
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,159
campaign

838
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,779
and on social media the uniqueness of

839
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,760
the shoe's design has sparked debate

840
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,500
even going back to Croc's early days

841
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,779
there were two warring factions of Crocs

842
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,520
are ugly and they're a blade on society

843
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,080
and we need to get rid of them I don't

844
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,120
care how comfortable they are they're

845
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,620
ugly and then there were people that

846
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,419
said no they're cute and they're kind of

847
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,720
doughy and they're fun look how freaking

848
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,140
to you these are Crocs leaned into this

849
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,059
polarization partnering with celebrities

850
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,039
and well-known Brands to create limited

851
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,559
edition versions of the classic clog I

852
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,880
think that's probably the biggest shift

853
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,200
within the Fashion World of the past

854
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,179
decade is that people truly seem to

855
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,279
design for Instagram because you want to

856
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,200
stop people from scrolling and certainly

857
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,299
a shoe plastered with fried chicken does

858
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,899
that in 2018 Crocs says it's Balenciaga

859
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:19,679
clog an 850 4-inch platform shoe sold

860
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,340
out within hours and in 2021 Crocs says

861
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,960
it partnered with more than two dozen

862
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,059
Brands artists and creators through

863
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,100
collaborations and license programs

864
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,899
sometimes it was through gibbets but

865
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,880
sometimes it was like these kind of

866
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,440
crazy revamping of what their clog was

867
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,700
constantly releasing new collaborations

868
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,039
has not only kept Crocs in the Press but

869
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,840
it has also helped it break into new

870
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,539
markets there are like Croc collectors

871
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:48,480
that go after every model Penny I am

872
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,580
overflowing with Crocs the same way that

873
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,860
Nike's resell on websites like stockx

874
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,440
and eBay Crocs are now reselling Crocs

875
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,000
and other comfortable shoes may have

876
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,980
peaked with the pandemic as people begin

877
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,080
to migrate back into work and consider

878
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,120
more traditionalist Footwear but many

879
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,980
others are still prioritizing Comfort

880
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,320
we're seeing that with a lot of doughy

881
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,820
running sneakers that people are wearing

882
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,500
we're seeing that certainly with the

883
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,299
growth of slides is a huge business in

884
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,460
the luxury Market crox's stock has

885
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,500
dropped around 60 percent since its

886
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,380
November 2021 High I think the Market's

887
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,419
nervous about the short term right so

888
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,399
we're definitely seeing um Supply

889
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:26,220
constraints um in the first quarter but

890
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,779
the company says its fourth straight

891
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,640
year of Revenue growth was fueled by

892
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,100
continued Global demand and it expects

893
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,200
revenues to grow to over 5 billion

894
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,799
dollars by 2026. I think that the

895
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,480
tow at a certain point you can only

896
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,000
reach so many consumers but I think for

897
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
now they have been able to convince

898
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,860
enough consumers that they deserve space

899
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,260
within their closet and they gotta have

900
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,539
the two fingers

901
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:53,399
Dollar General's business model it's a

902
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,840
retailer that can make a lot of money

903
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,480
selling very cheap Goods to a relatively

904
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,760
small number of people if you've ever

905
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,740
shopped at a Dollar General you might

906
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,360
have found the store on a remote Road

907
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,299
like this one it has every appearance of

908
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:07,860
being in the middle of nowhere but this

909
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,520
is a meticulously planned very well

910
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,800
thought through strategy a strategy

911
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,119
that's been key to Dollar General

912
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,699
success in Rural America

913
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,619
the company is Bucking current retail

914
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:22,440
Trends by expanding rapidly and opening

915
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,359
stores away from population centers

916
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:26,879
Dollar Generals go where Walmarts aren't

917
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,800
but it's not just the Strategic

918
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,899
locations far away from big box stores

919
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,239
Dollar General employs a number of

920
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,000
tactics to keep operating costs down

921
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,619
including leasing stores paying

922
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,659
employees low wages and selling limited

923
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,599
products and yes that includes stuff

924
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,520
that isn't really a dollar dollar

925
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,918
general is almost something unto itself

926
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,440
it kind of takes pieces from a lot of

927
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,599
different retailing models this is the

928
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,899
economics of Dollar General after more

929
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,580
than 30 consecutive years of sales

930
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,160
growth Dollar General has become one of

931
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,260
the most profitable and fastest growing

932
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,140
retailers in the US last year the

933
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,880
company brought in more than 30 billion

934
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,820
dollars in sales so how has a store that

935
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,520
sells products at rock bottom prices

936
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,680
manage such extreme growth they add

937
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,960
about two and a half stores every day in

938
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,359
the United States just for for scope

939
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,800
there's more than four times as many

940
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,720
Dollar Generals as there are Walmarts

941
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,220
there's more Dollar Generals than there

942
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,859
are McDonald's in the United States

943
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:27,839
there are currently more than seventeen

944
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,000
thousand Dollar Generals in the US but

945
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,980
if you don't live in Rural America you

946
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,480
might not have ever even stepped foot

947
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,280
inside the store where would you

948
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,200
typically find a Dollar General you'd

949
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,020
you'd think of a two-lane road think of

950
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,180
you know places where the houses are far

951
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,820
apart farmlands kind of lower income

952
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,680
communities you might find them by a

953
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,720
post office or a church or at an

954
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,060
important intersection this is often a

955
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,800
deliberate decision the company has

956
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,780
formulas for identifying locations to

957
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,060
open stores often the Dollar General

958
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,980
will be down the road miles away from

959
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,560
the nearest town and Walmart areas with

960
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,240
limited shopping options

961
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,099
three quarters of Dollar General stores

962
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,900
serve communities of twenty thousand

963
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,579
people or less according to the company

964
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,339
it looks for need first and foremost so

965
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:12,540
it's going to look for a place that we

966
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,339
might call a food desert where there are

967
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,079
not there's not a grocery store there's

968
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,540
not a big box store it's kind of Target

969
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,000
demographic is households uh with people

970
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,800
making forty thousand dollars or less

971
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,660
and it looks for a place where it can

972
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,300
get inexpensive real estate to keep

973
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,880
costs down Dollar General tends to lease

974
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,380
their properties rather than buy them

975
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,839
and inside the stores it has a limited

976
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,460
selection of products that it buys in

977
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,560
bulk which gives the company more buying

978
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,020
power with suppliers most Dollar General

979
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,599
stores don't offer fresh produce and

980
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,160
compared to grocery stores have less

981
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,200
perishable items which have a shorter

982
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,900
shelf life and bring in lower margins

983
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,240
you walk into a Dollar General you're

984
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,240
gonna see metal shelves it's going to be

985
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,060
quite Bare Bones I think linoleum think

986
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,579
you know think bright lighting you won't

987
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:02,220
see a lot of people working there

988
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,859
by paying low wages to a minimal often

989
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,260
part-time staff the company keeps labor

990
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,960
costs low the median annual income for

991
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,300
employees is just over sixteen thousand

992
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,859
dollars according to Dollar General

993
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,500
Dollar General says they employ more

994
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,240
than a hundred and fifty seven thousand

995
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,280
individuals and that they offer

996
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,859
employees competitive wages and benefits

997
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,440
these stores are staffed at minimum

998
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,359
levels so there's not there aren't many

999
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,619
employees they pay closer to a gas

1000
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,599
station attendant than even a Walmart

1001
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,599
employee so it's people that much like

1002
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,760
their customer base people who live in

1003
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,740
an area where there aren't a ton of

1004
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,060
other options

1005
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,760
despite the name not everything costs a

1006
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,859
dollar but prices are extremely cheap

1007
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:48,900
and often significantly lower than

1008
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,060
Grocery and drugstores

1009
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,980
critics say Dollar General strategies

1010
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,500
harm local communities by not providing

1011
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,599
healthy food options and potentially

1012
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,359
hurting the local small business economy

1013
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,400
Dollar General says that they are not a

1014
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,140
grocery store and that they are serving

1015
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,000
customers that would otherwise not have

1016
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,940
access to an affordable retail option

1017
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,440
ultimately the low prices and the

1018
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,480
convenience for Rural customers is what

1019
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,760
keeps people coming back some Shoppers

1020
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,820
have even found items for under a dollar

1021
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,200
Penny shopping at Dollar General let's

1022
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,119
go the first store I found Propel water

1023
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,500
for one cent at least is the Dollar

1024
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,359
General app scan and verify it's a penny

1025
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:25,800
before heading to the register Dollar

1026
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,900
General is on Pace to continue growing

1027
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,780
the company grew 16 during the pandemic

1028
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,180
a time where other retailers saw growth

1029
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,520
in e-commerce not in-person shopping

1030
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,920
Dollar General plans to open about a

1031
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,839
thousand stores this year and when you

1032
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,460
have a business model that involves

1033
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,820
small footprint stores without a lot of

1034
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,099
embellishments or bells and whistles a

1035
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,540
company can do that quickly and they can

1036
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,940
do it cheaply Dollar General is also

1037
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,320
branching out and going in New

1038
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,119
Directions it's been experimenting with

1039
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,800
stocking more fresh and refrigerated

1040
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,920
food and moving towards Urban centers it

1041
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,900
plans to expand pop shelf a new chain

1042
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,700
aimed at higher income Suburban

1043
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,880
customers pop shelf in addition to being

1044
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,220
located in different places it'll aim to

1045
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,960
sell things that are more think of more

1046
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,780
fun so not not as much Staples that you

1047
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,700
need to get by day to day but things

1048
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,980
like decorations party supplies a little

1049
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,099
bit more fun than necessary Dollar

1050
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,140
General says the new expansion isn't

1051
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,119
necessarily a shift from their overall

1052
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,700
growth strategy they say they can serve

1053
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,619
a diverse customer base with stores in

1054
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,160
urban Rural and Suburban locations yet

1055
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,900
even as Dollar General expands its

1056
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,359
offerings and Target demographics the

1057
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,280
company expects that its core customers

1058
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,200
will continue to be Shoppers in small

1059
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,820
towns without other options

1060
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,460
there really is a before and after

1061
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,540
Sephora when it comes to the makeup

1062
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,720
industry until about 20 years ago this

1063
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,760
is how most Americans shop for luxury

1064
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,980
makeup a sales representative of the

1065
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,020
brand would stand behind the makeup

1066
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,700
counter and help customers make a

1067
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,800
purchase that completely changed with

1068
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,079
Sephora now it's a free-for-all people

1069
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,880
walk in the stores they test whatever

1070
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,480
they want nothing is behind the glass so

1071
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,640
how did this French retailer come to

1072
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,619
dominate the global personal care and

1073
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,480
beauty product industry and what

1074
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,339
business practices helped make it the

1075
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:20,160
industry leader that it is today

1076
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,859
this is the economics of Sephora

1077
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,960
today the beauty retailer employs over

1078
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,440
36 000 people in more than 2 700 stores

1079
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,400
in over 35 countries those stores carry

1080
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,040
over 250 Beauty Brands

1081
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,320
at this point Sephora is like kind of my

1082
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,400
second home

1083
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,800
the Sephora that we know today has its

1084
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,720
roots in a small perfume shop that

1085
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,560
opened in 1969 in Limoges France at that

1086
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,359
time the perfume and cosmetics Market

1087
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,880
was dominated by a service-based retail

1088
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,220
model in which staff typically received

1089
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,859
commissions based on sales instead

1090
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:01,079
Sephora used the assisted self-service

1091
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,420
model in which customers are free to

1092
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,339
test products in the store we have a

1093
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:06,540
full station where you can just like

1094
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,640
literally grab whatever and you can try

1095
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,140
on the lipsticks you can try in the

1096
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,700
eyeshadows I always leave looking like a

1097
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,260
literal different person than I arrived

1098
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,540
Sephora customers can still request help

1099
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,060
from a sales associate who Sephora calls

1100
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,160
a beauty advisor there's a little bit

1101
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,720
more trust with the sales

1102
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,520
representatives in this Forest store

1103
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,040
because they're brand agnostic so they

1104
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,780
can tell you maybe you should buy them

1105
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,119
mascara from this brand but you should

1106
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,400
buy the blush from a different brand

1107
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,800
Sephora also bucked convention in the

1108
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,180
manner in which it displayed its

1109
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,880
products so makeup items are next to

1110
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,119
each other whereas from the same brand a

1111
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,320
fragrance would be in the fragrance

1112
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,359
aisle and the same brand a skin care

1113
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,859
product will be in the skincare aisle

1114
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:49,859
then in 1997 founder Dominic Montano

1115
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,079
sold Sephora to the large luxury retail

1116
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,780
conglomerate lvmh one of the advantages

1117
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,820
of being owned by a conglomerate like

1118
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,119
lmh is that the company can jump very

1119
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,420
quickly on Trends and actually several

1120
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,400
of the brands that are sold in Sephora

1121
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,980
stores are owned by lvmh one of the

1122
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,380
popular brands owned by lvmh is Fenty

1123
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,599
Beauty by Rihanna and then Fenty of

1124
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,060
course has a huge section the whole row

1125
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,420
of Fenty we got the lip glosses up front

1126
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,280
Sephora's success also stems from its

1127
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,380
exclusive line of products there's a

1128
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,460
little bit of attention in the

1129
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,380
relationship between a store and a brand

1130
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,099
because Sephora is such a hot store for

1131
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,760
makeup brands to sell their products in

1132
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,020
Sephora ends up having a lot more

1133
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,820
leverage in that relationship the

1134
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,160
Sephora collection the challenge for

1135
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,440
high-end Beauty Brands these days is

1136
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,119
that they're really facing a conundrum

1137
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,520
they've become increasingly dependent on

1138
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,380
Sephora for sales growth but because

1139
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,780
alvia Mage also produces Beauty Brands

1140
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,160
and there's an element of competition

1141
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,079
there and more brands are coming out

1142
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,240
constantly the shelves brace is

1143
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,640
shrinking five Sephora products you need

1144
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,859
to try part 10. in part due to that

1145
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,319
product exclusivity Sephora boasts a

1146
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,660
loyal customer base here are five

1147
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,220
Sephora products you need to buy tonight

1148
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,780
sorry I don't make the rules you just

1149
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,520
have to so what you'll find oftentimes

1150
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,140
on Instagram or Tick Tock is that people

1151
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,180
have these haul videos where they're

1152
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,500
showing all the products that they

1153
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,760
bought on Sephora and they're going one

1154
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,680
by one talking about them this is the

1155
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,800
closest tinted face oil and it's 42. I

1156
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,300
recommend this product to everyone and

1157
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,579
they're always like I'm paying 42

1158
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,359
dollars for a face oil yes you are many

1159
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,099
faithful customers are members of

1160
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,440
Sephora's Beauty Insider program which

1161
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,300
has three different tiers and more than

1162
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,300
25 million members the lowest here is

1163
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,920
the beauty Insider later

1164
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,740
the next level up is Vib or very

1165
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,839
important Beauty Insider which users

1166
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,060
must spend 350 dollars in a calendar

1167
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,940
year to unlock the top level is called

1168
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,280
Rouge which customers can access after

1169
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,319
spending at least a thousand dollars in

1170
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,599
a calendar year benefits like savings

1171
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,540
increase with each tier I'm Rouge don't

1172
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,339
judge me I know I spend a lot of money

1173
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,920
okay I get it but the real Advantage for

1174
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,540
Sephora for the beauty Rewards program

1175
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,540
is that every time a customer goes in

1176
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,220
there and Sephora knows exactly what

1177
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,800
they bought and that is very valuable

1178
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,480
information for the company to

1179
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,760
understand who the customer is what

1180
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,960
they're purchasing and then down the

1181
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,700
road to be able to Market in a very

1182
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,920
personalized way to that customer yet as

1183
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,240
much as the company profits on

1184
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,940
exclusivity with its products when it

1185
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,280
comes to Sephora's consumer base the

1186
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,339
retailer takes inclusivity seriously one

1187
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,079
of the ways that Sephora has tried to

1188
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,720
become more inclusive is by featuring a

1189
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,099
larger number of brands in their stores

1190
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,599
they made an effort to include black

1191
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,940
owned Brands and then also so by pushing

1192
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,880
Brands to expand their product lines and

1193
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,339
offer products that appeal to people

1194
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,619
from different racial groups different

1195
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:50,339
ethnicities in 2021 Sephora relaunched

1196
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:52,920
color IQ a skin tone matching technology

1197
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,839
that the company offers to assist

1198
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,819
customers in selecting the most natural

1199
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,500
products for their skin tone

1200
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,660
and Sephora is still expanding in

1201
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,880
December 2020 the company announced a

1202
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,380
partnership with the Department chain

1203
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,220
Kohl's to install 850 shops inside coal

1204
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,700
stores by 2023 since opening 200 Kohl's

1205
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,859
locations this summer Sephora has added

1206
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:19,800
200 000 new Beauty insiders in a

1207
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,240
statement to the Wall Street Journal a

1208
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,460
Sephora spokesperson said we want to be

1209
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,380
an unequivocal Global leader in the

1210
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,240
prestige Beauty space and a

1211
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,220
purpose-driven brand that is a

1212
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,260
transformative opportunity for Everyone

1213
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,599
We Touch they continued by outlining

1214
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,720
three main areas customers Brands and

1215
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,819
teams sometimes when customers step out

1216
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,440
say the Sephora store they will have

1217
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,660
splotches of makeup all over their arms

1218
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,700
and that really showcases what they've

1219
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,160
been doing in the store

1220
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,680
walk into a Target anywhere in the U.S

1221
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,720
and you're likely to find Sleek

1222
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,119
mannequins elaborate displays and fancy

1223
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,700
lighting Target is very focused on the

1224
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,200
Aesthetics of their stores their

1225
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,300
products that is what they hope makes it

1226
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,040
feel like an elevated Discount Store

1227
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,260
experience this elevated experience

1228
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,300
which has led some to nickname the store

1229
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,880
Target is part of the company's strategy

1230
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,099
to differentiate itself from competitors

1231
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,619
and draw customers through the door but

1232
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,000
what's happening in the front of a

1233
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,280
Target store is only a portion of the

1234
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,740
retailer secret to success

1235
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,579
this is the economics of Target Target

1236
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,760
to me is so interesting because really

1237
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,460
they're a department store that became a

1238
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,900
discount store and they were always

1239
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,700
going after sort of a higher end

1240
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,339
Discount Store image and that's remained

1241
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:38,700
true to today Target positions itself as

1242
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,760
the option for cheap yet Chic items and

1243
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,800
customers can see the two ideas combined

1244
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,839
when walking around the store

1245
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,720
in certain areas like apparel home goods

1246
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,359
and electronics Target stages items with

1247
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,819
lavish lighting and displays but just

1248
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,160
across the way you'll still find the

1249
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,260
standard merchandise aisles with uniform

1250
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,300
fluorescent lights target has always

1251
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,880
tried to sort of meld these like visual

1252
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,319
expectations that we have from a

1253
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,880
department store like the mannequins and

1254
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,160
the good lighting and like a display for

1255
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,200
Cosmetics with a discount model they

1256
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,099
also want you to feel like you're

1257
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:12,780
getting a good deal and I think you see

1258
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,400
that as they iterate on store designs

1259
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,500
they still strive for that combination

1260
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,900
according to a study by hawk incentives

1261
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,400
when a customer feels like they're

1262
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,020
getting a good deal it can make them

1263
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,000
feel smart and in turn increase sales

1264
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,700
don't get distracted to Target don't get

1265
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,040
distracted at Target don't get this to

1266
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,220
oh I need that retailers always are

1267
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,839
looking for this balance of things that

1268
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:34,800
bring you to the store that you need

1269
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,599
like a gallon of milk and the things

1270
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,400
that you might buy in a whim that they

1271
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,319
actually make more money off of Target

1272
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,240
store design is one of several factors

1273
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,040
that have helped the retailer expand in

1274
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,560
recent years the business has grown more

1275
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,540
than 35 percent in the last two years

1276
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,700
Crossing 100 billion dollars in annual

1277
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,619
revenue driven in large part by the

1278
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,599
pandemic and a decision Target made five

1279
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:56,940
years ago to invest in its stores you

1280
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,980
know lots of retailers said hey Amazon

1281
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,900
is here let's stop building stores let's

1282
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,640
remodel what we have let's develop an

1283
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,619
e-commerce model let's invest in other

1284
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,780
things target has continued adding

1285
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,460
stores some of them tend to be smaller

1286
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,440
stores different types of formats while

1287
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,940
they've invested in e-commerce but they

1288
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,440
haven't completely pulled back on

1289
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,540
expanding their store account the

1290
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,940
retailer has over 1900 locations in the

1291
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,859
U.S which is smaller than Walmart but

1292
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:22,500
bigger than Costco around 75 percent of

1293
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,660
the US population lives within 10 miles

1294
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,119
of one of these stores so Target like

1295
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,700
lots of retailer established retailers

1296
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,740
big retailers has this huge benefit

1297
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,359
right now which is they have the stores

1298
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,460
already and you probably live pretty

1299
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,619
close to one and that's enabled them to

1300
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,960
say offer things online for pickup in

1301
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,280
the store parking lot which has been

1302
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,900
wildly successful for them during the

1303
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,520
pandemic because they have that store

1304
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,720
for you to go and pick up your online

1305
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,020
order at the majority of operations like

1306
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,880
in-store and curbside pickup and

1307
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,680
fulfillment for online orders get

1308
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,680
started in the back room of the stores

1309
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,760
it's been so interesting because they

1310
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,859
started to say like we're going to use

1311
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,480
our stores we're not going to build big

1312
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,160
you know e-commerce warehouses we're

1313
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,359
going to use our stores several years

1314
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,040
ago and there was a little bit of

1315
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,480
skepticism in the market because it

1316
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,560
didn't seem like you could really be

1317
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,240
that efficient in that model but in the

1318
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,099
end they say they've saved a lot of

1319
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:13,200
money because a they're not building a

1320
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,819
huge Warehouse which costs a lot of

1321
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:16,560
money up front and you know they already

1322
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,819
have the trucks coming to their stores

1323
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:19,500
with their goods and they're just using

1324
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,200
those stores to the maximum possibility

1325
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,300
last year Target's brick and mortar

1326
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,460
locations handled more than 95 percent

1327
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,880
of over 100 billion dollars in sales so

1328
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,740
walk around any Target and you're likely

1329
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,020
to see this operation in action workers

1330
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,280
move carts throughout the store

1331
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,480
Gathering and scanning items

1332
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,980
While others watch for cars pulling up

1333
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,960
and deliver their orders in effect

1334
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,060
Target hires workers specifically for

1335
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,220
its fulfillment operations

1336
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,960
the company calls this role a

1337
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,819
fulfillment expert they're either out on

1338
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:52,980
the floor collecting Goods off the

1339
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,900
shelves just like a shopper whether in

1340
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,520
the back room packing up things into

1341
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,560
boxes getting them labeled appropriately

1342
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,119
they're really more like warehouse

1343
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,099
workers and now the company is taking

1344
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,960
this a step further in an effort to

1345
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,700
bridge the gap between its stores and

1346
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,740
its delivery location doing these things

1347
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,140
called certation centers which allow

1348
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,200
them to basically have or orders from

1349
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,880
stores that are being packed up by

1350
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,000
fulfillment workers sent to that more

1351
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,920
central location but still kind of close

1352
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,440
to stores and then picked up and sent

1353
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,560
out from there Target success is also

1354
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,780
strongly dependent on the items in its

1355
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,420
stores at any given time about one-third

1356
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,280
of Target's inventory is exclusive to

1357
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,720
the retailer through private labels

1358
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,060
similarly designers will often partner

1359
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,800
with Target for a limited time capsule

1360
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,480
collection

1361
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,520
these capsule collections for Target are

1362
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,740
sort of marketing right it's a way to

1363
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,500
say hey we're High design big designers

1364
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,420
are interested in working with us so it

1365
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,800
gives them a little bit of that cachet

1366
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,599
these collections are nearly as

1367
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,520
fundamental to Target as its Bullseye

1368
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,619
logo in the late 90s top makeup artist

1369
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,780
Sonia kashik partnered with Target to

1370
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,400
create a professional makeup line at

1371
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,800
affordable prices 16 years later Target

1372
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,140
bought the line and today this line is

1373
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,700
only one of Target's more than 45

1374
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,400
private labels they have become huge

1375
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,079
brands for Target and they've added more

1376
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,460
and more and now it's a pretty

1377
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,140
significant percentage of their sales

1378
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,240
and private label like at all companies

1379
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,880
can be lower price for the consumer but

1380
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,619
more profitable for the retailer so

1381
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,359
there's a big interest for any retailer

1382
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,760
going in that direction according to a

1383
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,099
report by CB insights retailers can earn

1384
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:28,980
25 to 30 percent higher gross margins on

1385
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,900
private labels compared to manufacturer

1386
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,880
Brands target has yet to share the

1387
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,040
precise margin on its private labels but

1388
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,319
currently 11 of its brands are worth at

1389
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:39,180
least one billion dollars with four

1390
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,599
brand fans crossing the 2 billion mark

1391
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,220
while target has transitioned through

1392
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,900
many iterations since it got its start

1393
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,540
in 1962. changing store designs many

1394
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,579
times and acquiring businesses within

1395
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,440
its larger brand the company continues

1396
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,880
to evolve with the ever-changing

1397
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,839
customer

1398
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:57,119
they tend to kind of change

1399
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,980
strategy quickly when things aren't

1400
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,079
working and I think we see them in the

1401
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:02,880
middle of potentially another version of

1402
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,859
that because the consumer is changing so

1403
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:06,720
much right now but even as the company

1404
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,780
evolves some aspects remain the same I

1405
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,220
think the most consistent thing for

1406
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,260
target has been this image this idea

1407
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,240
that they're an elevated brand they're

1408
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,040
different than their competitors they

1409
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,480
have stuck with that since the beginning

1410
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,140
and they still really lean on it today

1411
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,140
this is a tiny home on Airbnb so far

1412
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,880
this year this listing has brought in

1413
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,680
over twenty thousand dollars for its

1414
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,980
host the typical U.S host in 2021 earned

1415
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,480
over thirteen thousand eight hundred

1416
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,160
dollars according to the company the

1417
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,540
tiny home doesn't cost a lot to build

1418
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,339
and yet it could charge hundreds of

1419
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:40,859
dollars a night Airbnb posted a profit

1420
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,079
in its second quarter as guests booked a

1421
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:44,940
record number of stays and experiences

1422
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,160
and hosts increase prices for rentals

1423
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,260
amid High inflation but people didn't

1424
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,540
book as much as analysts had projected

1425
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,280
and the company's summer bookings

1426
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,200
forecast fell short of expectations

1427
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,240
obviously it's an incredibly Dynamic

1428
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,460
period of time but I'm still expecting

1429
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,079
an incredibly strong period of travel

1430
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:03,059
even if people pull back spending some

1431
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,280
so how did the largest Home Sharing

1432
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,260
platform in the U.S navigate its biggest

1433
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,420
crises and could it borrow those lessons

1434
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,000
to weather fears of a recession this is

1435
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,720
the economics of Airbnb

1436
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,339
Airbnb started around the time of the

1437
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:20,099
2008 financial crisis this was a time

1438
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,099
when people were really hard hit by the

1439
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,440
recession and they were looking for a

1440
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,380
way to make an extra buck in 2016 the

1441
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,240
company launched Airbnb experiences

1442
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,880
which led Travelers book classes tours

1443
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,819
and outings Airbnb also spent more as it

1444
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:38,579
grew the CEO branched out into all kinds

1445
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:40,859
of things like he wanted to have a media

1446
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:42,420
Studios he wanted to Branch into

1447
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,940
transportation and then the pandemic hit

1448
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,339
business was down 80 percent forcing

1449
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,619
Airbnb to take on two billion dollars in

1450
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:51,359
debt and pause all non-essential

1451
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,460
projects I hope I never do a side

1452
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,500
project again in my life I learned a

1453
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,359
lesson I think the lesson is when you

1454
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,040
try to do new things the side things

1455
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,859
they don't work summer of 2020 was a

1456
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:04,140
turning point for Airbnb people started

1457
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,420
quarantining with their families friends

1458
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,579
started taking staycations while they

1459
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,559
could work remote so that's something

1460
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,500
that definitely benefited Airbnb local

1461
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,660
travel became its strong hold and people

1462
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,520
started using the platform for longer

1463
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,680
stays the company was one of the hottest

1464
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,780
public listings of 2020 though its stock

1465
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,700
price has fallen since then amid a broad

1466
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,520
Market cool off in August Airbnb

1467
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,260
projected record third quarter revenue

1468
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,359
on the back of higher rental prices and

1469
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:31,980
said it expects to post its first

1470
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,140
full-year profit this year

1471
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,260
a lot of businesses have lucky moments

1472
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,300
but there's something to be said about

1473
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,180
getting lucky and also being able to

1474
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,760
ride that wave and capitalize on it

1475
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,980
that's what Airbnb says it has done from

1476
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,200
the start back then in 2008 a lot of

1477
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,940
people turned to hosting because they

1478
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,980
were losing their homes housing prices

1479
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,900
and a lot of people because they didn't

1480
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,640
have as much money were looking for more

1481
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,200
affordable ways to travel than ever

1482
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,079
before that really helped them bring a

1483
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:03,599
lot of people who were looking for ways

1484
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,180
to make up for lost income onto the

1485
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,099
platform and you can really see them

1486
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:10,619
capitalize on timing during the pandemic

1487
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:12,960
as well Airbnb redesigned its app and

1488
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,940
website to focus on local stays during

1489
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,220
the pandemic last summer it launched a

1490
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,900
flexible search feature which curates

1491
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,400
trips for people who don't know where

1492
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,619
they want to go the pandemic and remote

1493
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,780
work gave us that flexibility you know

1494
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,880
we could travel during the week and

1495
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,980
still work remote so Airbnb starts

1496
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,500
noticing this trend and it says oh my

1497
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,079
God we can you know we can sort of

1498
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,420
utilize on this and they do in May

1499
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,880
Airbnb launched another redesign of its

1500
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,800
Search tool that split homes into more

1501
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,960
than 50 categories as a way to steer

1502
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,700
people to places they wouldn't otherwise

1503
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,440
have picked so what they're trying to do

1504
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,420
is they're trying to fill existing homes

1505
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,940
instead of adding more and more homes

1506
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,579
some analysts say this is key to the

1507
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:55,380
company's future growth since Global

1508
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,599
occupancy rates are low

1509
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,280
when it comes to addressing safety

1510
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,380
issues on its platform some cities have

1511
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,240
complained that Airbnb has been too

1512
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,160
hands off they're not actively

1513
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,660
monitoring these properties because

1514
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,640
frankly they can't they don't own them

1515
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,800
so that's really where a lot of their

1516
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,200
problems stem from four people killed

1517
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,839
another fur heard all of it happening in

1518
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,720
a house rented out on Airbnb after a

1519
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,760
2019 Halloween shooting the company

1520
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,980
announced safety measures including a 24

1521
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,720
7 neighborhood hotline to field

1522
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,180
complaints we've banned all parties

1523
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,819
globally on Airbnb we have a risky

1524
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,440
reservation queue where we're looking at

1525
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,540
any suspicious activity and we have a

1526
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,460
pretty Hands-On team that's using some

1527
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,020
pretty Advanced like machine learning

1528
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,839
technology to essentially identify

1529
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,520
anything we think is suspicious if it is

1530
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,200
we'll continue to seek more information

1531
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,240
the company says the number of Party

1532
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,400
complaints have dropped 44 percent in

1533
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,859
the last two years Airbnb has also been

1534
00:56:49,859 --> 00:56:51,599
trying to reduce that rate further by

1535
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,280
doing things like blocking one or two

1536
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,780
night stays on New Year's Eve and

1537
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,700
Halloween for guests without a history

1538
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,400
of positive review use but instance keep

1539
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,280
happening earlier this year we had a

1540
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,400
shooting in Pittsburgh and again you

1541
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,920
know people were injured City officials

1542
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,380
have also blamed Airbnb for ruining the

1543
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,000
long-term rental market in some small

1544
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,099
communities what's happened is a lot of

1545
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:15,960
people are just snapping up properties

1546
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,680
and renting them and as a result locals

1547
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,599
don't have enough properties to rent

1548
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,900
long term Airbnb doesn't think that it's

1549
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,000
actually affected the long-term rental

1550
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,540
market but you know if you ask uh City

1551
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,640
officials they have a different story

1552
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,640
for example in 2020 the mayor of Sedona

1553
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,859
Arizona a tourist hotspot said that the

1554
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:40,079
demand for Airbnb rentals worsened the

1555
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,819
shortage of affordable housing and

1556
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:43,440
demolished the long-term rental market

1557
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,020
if we are you know part of the problem

1558
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,640
we are going to work with cities we've

1559
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,260
that's why we've done numerous

1560
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,119
agreements of cities to create

1561
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,400
restrictions we actually do want Airbnb

1562
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,260
to get more and more into long-term

1563
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,819
housing we want people to really feel

1564
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:59,280
invested in Community one of the things

1565
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,880
that Airbnb is doing now is it's trying

1566
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,900
to direct people to areas where it has

1567
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,819
Supply and that sort of also takes the

1568
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,640
load off of certain places that that

1569
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,160
everyone might go to and that might get

1570
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,520
sort of overburdened in April Airbnb

1571
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,140
announced that its employees can work

1572
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,880
from almost anywhere without a pay cut

1573
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,760
so if more businesses do follow airbnb's

1574
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,440
lead

1575
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,720
Airbnb stands to gain in its home rental

1576
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,240
business because that would mean more

1577
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,240
digital Nomads more people traveling and

1578
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,760
likely booking more airbnbs but some

1579
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,500
Travelers are concerned about Rising

1580
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,480
nightly rates and some analysts believe

1581
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,520
that hotel chains and competitors like

1582
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,500
Expedia group stand to gain as business

1583
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,599
travel picks up this year so the

1584
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,700
question is can Airbnb keep up the

1585
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,859
momentum we're an incredibly lean

1586
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,200
company we've already been preparing for

1587
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,760
a storm that what we thought was

1588
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,040
inevitable for years to come Airbnb

1589
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,480
dramatically cut costs during the

1590
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,700
pandemic and analysts have credited the

1591
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,680
company for keeping those down even as

1592
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,660
travel rebounded while a potential

1593
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,880
economic downturn could decrease demand

1594
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,160
Airbnb says it could also bring more

1595
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,619
hosts to the platform as the economy is

1596
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:11,880
going to be slowing down I think more

1597
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,900
and more people are going to be

1598
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,880
interested in saving money and I think

1599
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,780
they're also going to be interested in

1600
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,760
new ways to make money and unlike hotels

1601
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,299
with fixed

1602
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,859
fixed lighting properties that serve

1603
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,839
Travelers changing needs like it did

1604
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:26,880
during the switch to local travel I

1605
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,260
think even as we're entering recession

1606
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,480
people have been kind of isolated for

1607
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,859
years and they're yearning to get out

1608
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:32,940
and the one thing I think you're going

1609
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,500
to see them spend money on is they're

1610
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,020
going to continue to travel

1611
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,400
if you've ever seen a commercial for the

1612
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,559
Home Depot you might be familiar with

1613
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,680
this tune it's a good time to be a doer

1614
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,960
Home Depot and its theme song have

1615
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,880
inspired a wave of videos on social

1616
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,579
media

1617
00:59:49,579 --> 00:59:52,200
revealing its cultural status as the

1618
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,059
go-to Home Improvement store for many

1619
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:55,819
during the pandemic

1620
00:59:55,819 --> 00:59:58,500
Home Depot is the world's largest Home

1621
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,839
Improvement retailer with over 2 300

1622
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:03,660
stores across North America what we've

1623
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,059
seen is home price appreciation and

1624
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:09,180
housing activity at unprecedented levels

1625
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,460
and what we know is that when homes

1626
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,680
become more valuable those homeowners

1627
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,540
are more willing to spend on them with

1628
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,000
its 2021 fiscal year sales larger than

1629
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,220
both Lowe's and Ace Hardware combined

1630
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,319
one of Home Depot's biggest advantages

1631
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,180
is its foothold in the professional

1632
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,520
customer space that is electricians

1633
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,740
remodelers plumbers and other Home

1634
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,540
professionals that place more lucrative

1635
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,819
orders so how exactly has Home Depot

1636
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:34,559
attracted more professional customers

1637
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,599
and what other strategies have helped it

1638
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,460
become a leader in the Home Improvement

1639
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,079
retail industry

1640
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,440
this is the economics of Home Depot

1641
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,799

1642
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,260
floor space dozens of long aisles with

01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,640
Hardware to tools to major appliances

1648
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,240
store stocks about thirty thousand to

1649
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,980
forty thousand items throughout the year

1650
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,260
most locations are around one hundred

1651
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,480
four thousand square feet the scale of

1652
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,980
the store gives customers the

1653
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,260
opportunity to buy raw materials in bulk

1654
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,599
and pick up items quickly they try to be

1655
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,880
somewhere that you can go if you're just

1656
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,339
an individual trying to fix up something

1657
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:22,200
in your kitchen they also try to be a

1658
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,180
place that you can go if you're a

1659
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,660
contractor trying to buy lumber to help

1660
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,940
renovate somebody's home or if you're a

1661
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,920
plumber that needs all kinds of pipe

1662
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,980
fittings so they really try to be a good

1663
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,900
source on both sides of that equation

1664
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,660
Home Depot began when co-founders Bernie

1665
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,700
Marcus and Arthur Blank were fired from

1666
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,500
a home improvement company called handy

1667
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,599
dance they wanted to launch a store that

1668
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,280
would be significantly bigger and

1669
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,460
cheaper than competitors in 1979 they

1670
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,020
opened their first two Home Depot

1671
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:55,260
locations in Atlanta the Home Depot the

1672
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,640
founders had a vision for a home

1673
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,319
improvement retailer that could be a

1674
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,420
One-Stop shop for the DIY or do

1675
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,400

Improvement customer to us is unique

1678
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,920
they're a doer that's where that word

1679
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,380
comes from since its founding Home Depot

1680
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,420
has grown into a multi-billion dollar

1681
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,760
company that increasingly caters to the

1682
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,859
professional contractor as well as the

1683
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:19,319
DIY consumer while many Industries like

1684
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,240
service and Hospitality took a hit

1685
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,280
during the pandemic Home Depot's Revenue

1686
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,980
continued to grow the pandemic fueled a

1687
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,140
boom in the Home Improvement industry as

1688
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,180
people spent more time and money on

1689
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,400
remodeling projects but between middle

1690
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,640
of 2020 in the middle of 2021 there were

1691
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,200
four straight quarters where Home Depot

1692
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,299
grew its sales by more than 20 percent

1693
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:41,460
year over year which is a very fast pace

1694
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,859
for a large established company Home

1695
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:45,720
Depot says they are seeing increasing

1696
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,460
demand for professional projects as

1697
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,900
people feel comfortable inviting

1698
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,460
contractors back into their homes

1699
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:54,359
there's been this buildup of projects

1700
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:57,180
that require professionals that more

1701
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,980
recently people have been willing to get

1702
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,960
to and that's sort of led to a second

1703
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,540
wind of sales growth what kind of person

1704
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:08,940

1705

Carly a carpenter Home Depot has

1706
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:13,380
positioned itself to attract more

1707
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,119
business from these contractors and home

1708
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,099

percent of its customer base in

1714
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,420

1717
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,599
key part of its Pro customer strategy

1718
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,480
Home Depot has invested 1.2 billion

1719
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,280
dollars in expanding its supply chain

1720
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,319

01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:52,619

deliver orders directly to a project

1729
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,000

01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,940
to our Pros is delivery of product to

1731
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,460

strategy giving Pro customers more

1744
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,380
flexible options that better align with

1745
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,359
busy schedules we're one of the largest

1746
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:44,280
e-commerce retailers in the country by

1747
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,319
volume when people come to pick up

1748
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,720
orders from our lockers or from our

1749
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,359
service desk they often shop for more

1750
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,280
products in the store and so that's an

1751
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,559
economic flywheel that our website

1752
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,420
creates for our company these

1753
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,740
possibilities have really helped the

1754
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,720
company grow its sales quite a bit over

1755
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,420
the last two years sales from e-commerce

1756
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,400
channels have gone up by about a hundred

1757
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,619
percent so basically doubled though Home

1758
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,240
Depot has seen a long period of

1759
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,920
consistent Revenue growth the Home

1760
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,900
Improvement retail space remains a

1761
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,359
competitive and fragmented Market this

1762
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:18,420
is a space where customers are very

1763
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:22,020
sensitive to prices so if one brand is

1764
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,700
charging a higher price for a certain

1765
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,440
type of equipment that's something that

1766
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,359
buyers could pick up on and could easily

1767
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,579
shift to another retailer so Home Depot

1768
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:32,520
is definitely very sensitive to other

1769
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,740
big chains to smaller mom and pop stores

1770
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:37,140
the industry is also sensitive to

1771
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,480
economic fluctuations especially with

1772
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,099
spending Trends tied to the housing

1773
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:43,680
market going back to the Great Recession

1774
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,960
and the financial crisis 10 years ago

1775
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,760
that was a very difficult time for Home

1776
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,099
Improvement retailers a turbulent period

1777
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:51,900
for Home Depot in the last couple years

1778
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,760
during the pandemic that housing

1779
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,160
Market's been very strong certainly a

1780
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,319
company that would be in a very

1781
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,359
different position if there was some

1782
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:02,220
kind of big downturn in the housing

1783
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,880
market in general

1784
01:06:05,339 --> 01:06:07,579
