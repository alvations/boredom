790
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,039
let's say you wanted

791
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,760
to buy a popular Rolex Daytona watch a

792
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,120
new one would cost you

793
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
$14,800 but if you wanted to buy a used

794
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,640
version of the same watch you might need

795
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,679
to pay over

796
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,279
$38,000 so why people spending more

797
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,799
money to get a used Rolex if you use

798
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,080
your watch primarily for 10 in the time

799
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,880
then we're not of the same mindset

800
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,600
here's why the used watch Market is

801
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,760
booming and what Rolex is doing to get

802
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,120
in on the action this is the economics

803
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,770
of used

804
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,440
[Music]

805
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,799
Rolexes experts suggest that it takes

806
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,880
about a year to make a Rolex and weight

807
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,960
list for new watches can last months to

808
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,399
years and because of that these days you

809
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,200
can't walk into any Rolex store any

810
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
Rolex dealer and just get any watch that

811
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,039
you want for the past few years as

812
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,159
demand has increased Rolex has not been

813
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:33,799
able to keep up with that demand their

814
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,600
production just can't match the number

815
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,399
of people that want a Rolex if you've

816
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:39,519
got 10 $220,000 to burn you really want

817
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,159
a watch you're probably going to go to

818
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:42,720
the resale Market because the watch that

819
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,760
you want is going to be available there

820
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,880
and so the prices on the resale Market

821
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,480
have then gone up because there's more

822
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,360
people going to that market 29% of

823
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,159
collectors reported paying more than

824
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,960
retail price for their most recent

825
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,880
pre-owned watch according to a report

826
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,679
from Boston Consulting Group and 40%

827
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,799
said that one of their top reasons was

828
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,399
that they were able to avoid long

829
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,159
waiting lists in the firsthand Market

830
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,039
this has created a boom in the secondary

831
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,000
Market pre-owned watch sales reached 22

832
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,159
billion in 2021 the used sector is

833
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,080
actually growing faster than the primary

834
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,600
market and for some people used watches

835
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,679
are worth more than new ones that's

836
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:22,320
because some rare styles are more

837
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,080
desirable or because Rolex has

838
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,519
discontinued certain models and colors

839
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,320
in in older model Rolex can have a

840
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,080
patina it can have some wear marks and

841
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,600
so those kind of personal details those

842
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,320
kind of personal age marks those are

843
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,080
things that collectors might want there

844
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,919
is also a bragging rights thing where if

845
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,159
you have a Rolex from the 70s or the 80s

846
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,399
you're able to say it's from this era

847
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,720
it's you know 20 30 years older than I

848
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,360
am and that is just kind of cool to

849
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,279
collectors in a way the market about a

850
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,399
decade ago was softer than it is right

851
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,559
now back then you could sell a watch and

852
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,519
get a return on it but you could also

853
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,159
sell a Rolex and it could have

854
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,639
depreciated value when you could lose

855
00:32:57,639 --> 00:32:59,919
money on it these days you now will

856
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,639
likely make more money off of it if you

857
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,679
sell it on the resale Market much of the

858
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,799
success of the used watch Market is due

859
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,679
to the rise of online watch resale

860
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,519
marketplaces over the past decade that's

861
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,120
where people like Paul and Carol come in

862
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,880
can yell at get over there buddy the

863
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,320
husband and wife Duo run Bob's watches

864
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,919
an online Marketplace for buying selling

865
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:23,240
and trading luxury watches they say that

866
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,720
they currently have one of the largest

867
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,159
selections of used Rolex watches in the

868
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,399
world I started out in the watch

869
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:32,159
business because I could see that there

870
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,360
was no real safe transparent honest

871
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,200
place for people to buy and sell

872
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,840
pre-owned watches it's been an upward

873
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,039
Trend since 2010 we've been growing

874
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,600
consistently about 30 to 40%

875
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,360
year-over-year two years ago we did uh

876
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,200
$100 million in sales there's so much

877
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,519
more for us to tap into that we haven't

878
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,200
had the bandwidth to get to because the

879
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,440
growth has been so so fast and furious

880
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,559
and Paul and Carol love Rolexes sales of

881
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,760
used watches online already exceed

882
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,840
auction and store sales and one report

883
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,480
predicts they're going to reach close to

884
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,440
60% of the secondhand luxury Market by

885
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,480
2026 during the pandemic the stock

886
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,199
market goes crazy you have the kind of

887
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,199
crypto phenomenon you have meme stocks

888
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,119
happening and people have a lot of extra

889
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,760
capital and they're taking that in many

890
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,159
cases and they're putting it toward

891
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,719
assets um luxury goods and in a lot of

892
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,399
cases watches starting in 2020 used

893
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,280
luxury watches sold for 1.5 to three

894
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,359
times their retail prices Rolex is a

895
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,800
brand that's really recognizable in its

896
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,719
design it's you know easy to spot on the

897
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,440
street and a lot of people they'll see

898
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,918
that their friend has a given Rolex and

899
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,679
they think I want that too but Rolex the

900
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,280
company only sold new watches which

901
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,839
meant that the brand wasn't involved

902
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,159
with used watch sales that is until late

903
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,280
2022 Rolex opened a certified pre-owned

904
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,800
program for its used watches retailers

905
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,879
can send used Rolexes that are at least

906
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,440
3 years old back to the watch maker the

907
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,720
certified pre-own program verifies that

908
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,880
a watch is an authentic Rolex and works

909
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,520
properly then retailers can sell the

910
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,960
watch with an official Rolex certificate

911
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,760
the program is already active in one

912
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,200
retail chain in six different countries

913
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,760
another chain of official Rolex

914
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
retailers in the US will enter the

915
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,160
program this may buying a watch with

916
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,359
Rolex certification could be a draw for

917
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,680
firsttime buyers you're buying a watch

918
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,040
on the internet it can be a little bit

919
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,079
of a daunting experience of all the

920
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,960
watches on our website today almost 50%

921
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,440
of them already have the original box

922
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,760
and papers from Rolex we've offered a

923
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,839
CPO program a certified pre-owned

924
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,800
program now for almost 5 years the only

925
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,160
thing really new about it is that Rolex

926
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,960
is certifying and doing the paperwork

927
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,880
behind it so I don't feel that there's

928
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,240
any increased competition but I do feel

929
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,280
that the market is big enough for

930
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,319
everybody to participate today people

931
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:52,440
buy Rolexes online the way that they

932
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,920
might buy toilet paper so it's really

933
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,040
not a premium or specialized experience

934
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,400
there's still that consumer that wants

935
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,720
to have that experience of going into a

936
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,319
store of being waited on of kind of

937
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:02,839
being shown watches from a glass display

938
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:04,880
case and making it feel more special

939
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,040
because they're buying something of such

940
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,240
a high value this certified pre-owned

941
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,319
program means that Rolex can take a cut

942
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:12,280
out of a market that it previously left

943
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,599
untapped but things might continue to

944
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,880
shift for the luxury watch Market the

945
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,960
used watch Market is cooling down as

946
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
sellers eager to make a profit have

947
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,440
flooded the market with inventory recent

948
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,680
data shows the number of Rolex watches

949
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,920
available to buy second in hand roughly

950
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,599
doubled from the beginning of 2022 to

951
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,160
September of the same year on those

952
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,000
really coveted kind of brand name

953
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,200
watches so to speak the ones that

954
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,119
collectors talk about the resale value

955
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,760
has gone down a little bit resellers

956
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,520
people that watch that market they do

957
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,200
say that the prices have come back down

958
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,720
to earth a little bit but the volume of

959
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,800
sales the amount of sales happening that

960
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,440
Still Remains pretty high we're seeing

961
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,079
still a large number of transactions in

962
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,760
the resale Market your day and day out

963
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,720
Rolex is still retaining a lot of value

964
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,160
on the resale Market you can still get a

965
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,880
pretty good return turn for it as with

966
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,560
any resale Market there is a risk that

967
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,520
the Rolex Market can fall out at any

968
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,200
time 5 years ago we might not have been

969
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,520
talking about how crazy this Market is

970
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,040
and 5 years from now we might not be

971
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,720
talking about how crazy this Market is

972
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,520

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,079
extent both things can be true you know

974
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,319
people that watch this Market will say

975
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:13,480
that that's just actually a reflection

976
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,400

977
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,119
can behave in many different ways just

978
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,200
because it is this kind of really large

979
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,520
transactional Marketplace
