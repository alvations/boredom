it's that time of year when

302
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,920
vacant storefronts temporarily transform

303
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000
into Spirit Halloween that spooky

304
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,800
seasonal retailer that's seemingly

305
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,639
everywhere overnight for Spirit

306
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,600
Halloween a pop-up lease is ideal

307
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,920
because then they're only paying for

308
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,639
space when they truly need it guess

309
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,920
what's finally open the spirit store

310
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,160
happy day happy day and with consumers

311
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,800
expected to spend a record amount for

312
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,160
the holiday spirit Halloween has opened

313
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,440
more stores than ever this year so how

314
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,279
does Spirit Halloween capitalize on

315
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,720
abandoned spaces in local markets and

316
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,560
how does it manage to transform those

317
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,120
vacant storefronts so quickly this is

318
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,440
the economics of Spirit Halloween the

319
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,920
first Spirit Halloween popped up in 1983

320
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,000
in Castro Valley California it was an

321
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
extension of founder Joe marver women's

322
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,560
clothing store traditionally October is

323
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,760
a very slow month for for retail General

324
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,480
and there was a Halloween store in the

325
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Strip Center that he operated and he saw

326
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,800
that there were lines coming out store I

327
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,519
said that might be a good idea and so

328
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,800
with that he turned his Boutique into a

329
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,240
Halloween store and uh kind of the rest

330
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,320
is history in 1999 marver sold the

331
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,519
company to Spencer Gifts that mall store

332
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,680
known for gag gifts and it's built a

333
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,959
reputation among those who love

334
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,240
Halloween so much so that more than

335
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,480
2,000 fans showed up to the July grand

336
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,160
opening of the flagship store in New

337
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,639
Jersey but the retailer is hoping last

338
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,279
minute Shoppers come through the door

339
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:27,040
too one of the advantages is that

340
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,760
they're everywhere so if someone has

341
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,959
forgotten about Halloween and needs to

342
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,800
get a last minute costume and can't wait

343
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,240
for it to be delivered after it was

344
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,399
bought online then they can just pop

345
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,519
into a Spirit Halloween while Shoppers

346
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,240
can buy Halloween fair on the company's

347
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,600
website at any time none of its physical

348
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
locations operate year round Spirit

349
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,160
Halloween prefers a temporary lease

350
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,759
because it is not a year round business

351
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,040
so for them they want to save as much

352
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,600
money as possible on real estate and so

353
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
it makes much more sense for them to

354
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,199
take space temporarily spirit Halloween

355
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,519
says convincing landlords wasn't easy at

356
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,040
first years ago when we sat down with

357
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,000
landlords and said hey we've got this

358
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,800
idea we got a popup Halloween store or

359
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,600
we're going to come for two months we

360
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,040
get the look of uh you know really what

361
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,720
you know why why would I bother with

362
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,880
that though landlords tend to prefer

363
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,160
long-term leases popups can be an

364
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,920
alternative to empty space in the Years

365
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,480
following the Great Recession as retail

366
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,079
vacancies increased landlords found that

367
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,959
pop-ups were effective way of filling

368
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,519
space that had been vacant for a long

369
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,839
time because of course some revenue is

370
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,040
better than no revenue and to make

371
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,680
temporary leases more attractive to

372
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,720
landlords the company adds kickout

373
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,839
Clauses if they find a space where they

374
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,240
want to open but the landlord finds

375
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,920
another tenant who's willing to sign a

376
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,560
long-term lease before a certain day

377
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,040
maybe it's middle of June for example

378
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,560
then Spirit Halloween loses that

379
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,519
space for Spirit Halloween finding real

380
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,399
estate is a year-round business business

381
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,440
when stores shut down for one season the

382
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,079
company is already talking to landlords

383
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,759
about the next big spaces are key up to

384
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,360
50,000 Square ft often where big box

385
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,880
retailers used to live those storefronts

386
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,639
are often in shopping centers or strip

387
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,120
malls but can also be Standalone and

388
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,160
signing the lease is just the beginning

389
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,120
the retailer says setting up the stores

390
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,519
is another logistical challenge I mean

391
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,560
literally we are starting from scratch

392
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,279
in every single store we inherit an

393
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,279
empty

394
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,639
location and we have to bring in not

395
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,920
only all the merchandise but all the

396
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,160
fixturing we have to hire the entire

397
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,360
staff according to the National Retail

398
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,480
Federation spending on Halloween is

399
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,319
expected to hit a record $10.6 billion

400
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,040
in 2022 on average customers are

401
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,800
planning to spend $100 each on costumes

402
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,519
Decor candy and cards this year and 36%

403
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,360
of customers plan to shop at specialty

404
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,000
stores like Spirit Halloween and with

405
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,440
1,450 stores across across the US and

406
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
Canada it's one of the most ubiquitous

407
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,560
it's a sign of fall it's kind of like

408
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,519
you get your pumpkin spice latte you're

409
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,000
back to school you see Spirit Halloween

410
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,959
open up in shopping centers on your

411
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,000
drive to work one of its biggest

412
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,160
competitors Party City's popup Ranch

413
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,519
Halloween City operated 275 stores in

414
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,639
2019 and scaled back during the pandemic

415
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,560
Spirit Halloween's popup model has

416
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,399
become such a fixture of the Season that

417
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,720
it's inspired a new movie popup

418
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,079
Halloween store in creepy lot aome and

419
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,279
countless internet memes people joke

420
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,079
about how quickly the company moves in

421
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,279
after something else shuts down we kind

422
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,199
of enjoy the meme value of of spirit we

423
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,000
bring life and we bring joy we bring

424
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,880
energy we bring a whole you know new

425
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,600
reason and so uh the mean value of

426
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,920
spirit is recognition of of of that

427
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,880
value that's part of the reason Spirit

428
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,720
Halloween decided to open all of its

429
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,440
planned 14400 stores in 2020 while comp

430
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,839
competitors opened fewer during the

431
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,040
covid-19 pandemic in 2021 the company

432
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
said it experienced product delays and

433
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,640
increased shipping costs last year we

434
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,319
didn't realize the the magnitude of the

435
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,720
issue with the Spy chain until April and

436
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,559
when suddenly everything dried up by the

437
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,319
end of the season we had received all of

438
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,160
our merchandise but it was through it

439
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,640
was through some really difficult

440
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,839
cartwheels and somersaults the retailer

441
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,760
says all of its locations are fully

442
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,679
stocked this year I just mov with

443
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,200
Halloween

444
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,320
for fans of Halloween the company wants

445
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,200
to be the beginning of the holiday

446
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,320
coming to a Spirit Halloween is an event

447
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,160
it's something that the fans really look

448
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,600
forward to it's almost like the new

449
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,120
season and when we come that's when

450
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,080
Halloween starts and for landlords with

451
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,400
empty storefronts Spirit Halloween

452
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,760
continues to temporarily bring life back

453
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,720
to those abandoned

454
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,520
spaces Chipotle's menu only has a few

455
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,120
items but it's highly customizable born

456
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,919
in 1993 that's what's made Chipotle one

457
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:02,919
of the most successful fast casual

458
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,200
restaurant chains in the US but in

459
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
recent years Chipotle's faced many

460
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,360
challenges between 2015 to 2018 Chipotle

461
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,440
dealt with five foodborn illness

462
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,520
outbreaks like most of the restaurant

463
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,799
industry Chipotle's Revenue took a big

464
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,440
hit during the beginning of the coron

465
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,039
virus pandemic and today it's dealing

466
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,159
with inflation that's increased labor

467
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:26,679
transportation and food costs yet

468
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,880
despite these setbacks Chipotle sales

469
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
are actually growing here's how

470
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,320
Chipotle's focus on efficiency and

471
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,480
Innovation helped it bounce back and

472
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,159
become one of the country's most

473
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,679
valuable Quick Service chains this is

474
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,159
the economics of

475
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,480
Chipotle Chipotle's Revenue has

476
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,039
increased by more than 200% over the

477
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,120
past decade its stock price has

478
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,280
increased about 400% in The Last 5 Years

479
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
much of Chipotle's success comes from

480
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,640
its efficient and what it calls

481
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,240
transparent instore experience Chipotle

482
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,600
has really in a lot of ways made the

483
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,039
whole fast casual category for

484
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,280
restaurants it's not fast food it's not

485
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,600
full service they've generated a lot of

486
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,679
sales from people who want this

487
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,840
alternative that's seems fresher and

488
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,840
faster than fast food but it's not a

489
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,440
full service experience fast casual

490
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,960
design can help them reduce some of

491
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
their labor expenses which helps with

492
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,480
profits Chipotle's menu is relatively

493
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,720
small but it's easy to customize there's

494
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,159
tons of stuff you can put on your meal

495
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,840
that's proteins that's cheeses that's

496
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,960
vegetables that's all the salsas and

497
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,480
sauces and for customer that makes it

498
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,039
exciting you know they get lots of

499
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,240
different things they can customize

500
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,760
their meal with the more limited menu in

501
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,400
general is better for restaurants and

502
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,600
their profits it's less things to train

503
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,880
the restaurant workers on it's less

504
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,760
waste Chipotle's founder Steve ell

505
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,039
emphasized having an open kitchen he

506
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,679
wanted customers to be able to see the

507
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,559
ingredients and preparation in front of

508
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,520
them today employees work at individual

509
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,280
stations to serve already prepared

510
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,400
ingredients making the ordering process

511
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,520
more efficient for customers we can

512
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,000
serve as many as 100 customers within a

513
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,720
15-minute period what's a better way

514
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,320
than telling people that it's fresh

515
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,640
showing them let them come in and

516
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,960
discover for themselves this

517
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
transparency has been very important for

518
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,320
Chipotle especially after its food

519
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,960
safety issues after several outbreaks of

520
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,600
eoli salmonella and norovirus in

521
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Chipotle restaurants the company

522
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,320
implemented several changes like

523
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
improving food preparation and storage

524
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,520
procedures encouraging sick employees to

525
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,400
stay at home and bringing on a new CEO

526
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,120
Brian nickel he really did emphasize

527
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,440
that they cleaned up their procedures

528
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,640
didn't happen immediately but with time

529
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
people start to forget things too there

530
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,520
hasn't been the big high-profile scares

531
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
that there were previously after several

532
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,400
outbreaks between 2015 and 2018

533
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,679
Chipotle's stock price took a hit

534
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,480
however its focus on its digital

535
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,600
ordering platforms helped Drive drive up

536
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,919
revenue and stock prices started to

537
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:04,039
climb back in 2008 Chipotle became one

538
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,960
of the first fast casual chains to

539
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,400
create an online store pickup model in

540
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,760
its first year Chipotle's digital sales

541
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,919
accounted for $13 million or just 1% of

542
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,240
its total sales in 2022 digital sales

543
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,600
grew to $3.4 billion that's now nearly

544
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,799
40% of Chipotle's food and beverage

545
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,080
Revenue if you're ordering online

546
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,120
digitally that is made for you at a

547
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,559
whole separate part of the kitchen which

548
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,799
is just dedicated to online orders

549
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,559
Chipotle's app and online ordering

550
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,400
systems were also vital during the

551
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,279
pandemic the pandemic obviously was

552
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,200
terrible for all restaurants but

553
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,360
Chipotle did have some advantages there

554
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,279
in that they had this whole digital

555
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,880
ordering platform really set up and

556
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,480
scaled beforehand when the pandemic

557
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,200
first hit we saw that people stopped

558
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,559
going to restaurants for some period of

559
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,880
time so we saw our sales drop uh pretty

560
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,000
significantly but it only took like a

561
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,960
week or two before we started to see

562
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,200
that while they first stopped visiting

563
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,640
restaurants the adoption of the digital

564
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,559
ordering really picked up very very

565
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,039
quickly and so I would say within the

566
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,159
first four weeks we had our digital uh

567
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,159
uh ordering soore from about 18% to it

568
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:15,640
at one point hit 70% Chipotle also

569
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,480
designed its stores to have two separate

570
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,039
prep stations called make lines one make

571
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,640
line is just for inore orders and the

572
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,520
other is for digital and Catering orders

573
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
this made food pickups quicker for

574
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
customers who didn't want to spend time

575
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,559
indoors this idea that we had the

576
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,320
digital make line so that as people were

577
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,919
ordering we could make food on the

578
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,799
digital make line and also serve

579
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,600
customers that were choosing to come in

580
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,799
so it was a seamless experience like

581
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,360
most stocks during 2020 they were still

582
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,240
lower than they were before the pandemic

583
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,919
but by the end of the first year into

584
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,240
the second year most stocks had you know

585
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,080
fully recovered we had our all-time high

586
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,039
in 2021 recently Chipotle has continued

587
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,279
to expand its digital ordering services

588
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,440
with a new pickup option for customers

589
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,600
called chipot Lanes let's go ahead and

590
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,279
take offer all the convenience of the

591
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,480
drivethru but when you order ahead of

592
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,600
time you know exactly what time to come

593
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,840
and so there's no ly you drive up and

594
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,279
you pull to our window you get your food

595
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,159
and off you go the first chipot Lane

596
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,679
opened in 2018 and there are already

597
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,000
nearly 600 across the US Chipotle says

598
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,320
at least 80% of new restaurant locations

599
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,240
opening in 20123 will have chipot Lanes

600
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
but that's just one example of how

601
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,960
Chipotle has continued to innovate to

602
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,080
attract customers social media has been

603
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,200
great for us because in addition to

604
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
making sure we're serving you know the

605
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,279
meals that that customers come to expect

606
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,200
at Chipotle we also want to be part of

607
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,480
culture Chipotle frequently uses social

608
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,440
media to attract younger consumers by

609
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,240
releasing recipe videos animated short

610
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,440
films Roblox games and social media

611
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,240
campaigns like the lid flip challenge

612
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
with major influencers Chipotle has also

613
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,400
used social media to drum up excitement

614
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,480
about new menu items and innovate its

615
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,640
menu options to keep up with consumer

616
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,960
Trends adding new things for customers

617
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,679
is very important to Chipotle and they

618
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,520
have a whole process for this where they

619
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,640
try and try these items in house really

620
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,840
test and learn before they test in

621
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,520
stores they like menu news whether it's

622
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,120
you know a steak item or a chicken item

623
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,240
alpastor quesadillas they want to keep

624
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,880
customers interested even if most of

625
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,520
their menu is staying the same so what's

626
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,000
next for Chipotle in general the online

627
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
ordering even when you pick it up in the

628
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,480
restaurant is just much more efficient

629
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,320
the company says it wants to open more

630
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,480
locations that are only used for online

631
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,440
pickup orders they won't have any

632
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,240
seating for customers this will also cut

633
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,399
down on labor costs since workers won't

634
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,000
need to clean seating areas and

635
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,200
bathrooms as often we think the idea is

636
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,760
let the customers choose which channel

637
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,720
they want now our job is to make sure

638
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,200
every channel is convenient it's easy

639
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,840
it's fast so that we don't give any

640
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,440
friction whatsoever but make sure every

641
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,760
experience that you can provide on every

642
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,720
channel is a great one a puma cotton

643
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,840
blend t-shirt on Vince's site cost $85

644
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,480
but the same shirt sells for $29.99 at

645
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,279
TJ Maxx so why does it cost less over 10

646
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,520
years the off-price retailer has opened

647
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,039
263 more stores in 2022 TJX which owns

648
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,679
TJ Maxx Marshalls and Homegoods brought

649
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,480
in almost $50 billion in sales revenue

650
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,159
more than Nordstrom's and Macy's

651
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:27,840
combined and the secret to its success

652
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,799
the company isn't shifting most of its

653
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,000
business online or using big data to

654
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,399
figure out what Shoppers want instead

655
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,880
it's sticking to a decades old Playbook

656
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
get the max for

657
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,760
minimim

658
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,480
[Music]

659
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,279
it's this is the economics of TJ Maxx

660
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,120
there are really two components to TJ

661
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,399
Maxx's strategy the bargain and the hunt

662
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:55,720
One Way TJ Maxx gets discounted Goods is

663
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,880
by buying excess merchandise and cancel

664
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,240
orders from other brands and retailers

665
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,960
essentially it takes advantage of

666
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,520
surplus and waste in the retail system

667
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,000
this allows the company to sell its

668
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,679
merchandise generally around 20 to 60%

669
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,240
below regular retail prices but there's

670
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,640
a catch just the fact that the price is

671
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,320
low is not enough what you need is also

672
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,679
a reference price because people don't

673
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:20,679
know how much things cost that's where

674
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,200
Alex says something known as the

675
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,159
anchoring effect comes in at TJ Maxx

676
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,200
most items have two prices the T J Maxx

677
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,039
price and a comparison price people

678
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,279
anchor the the regular price and then

679
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,919
they see exactly how much of a deal

680
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,799
they're getting and this way they really

681
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,600
understand what the value is that DJ

682
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,640
Maxx provides to them take these Rag and

683
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,200
Bone shorts a TJ Maxx in Manhattan sold

684
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,279
them for about $40 with a comparison

685
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,559
price of $50 that's a 20% discount but

686
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,480
the original price tag happened to be on

687
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,760
these shorts and it lists the price as

688
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,279
$195 that would be around 80% discount

689
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,240
and that comparison price is really just

690
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,000
an estimate on TJ Maxx's website there's

691
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,840
a message next to the comparison price

692
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,919
that says these prices are references to

693
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,080
regular retail prices where identical

694
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,159
items are not available we compare to

695
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,240
products of a similar type quality and

696
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,840
style these price tags aren't the only

697
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,080
way TJ Max helps customers feel like

698
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,159
they're getting a bargain the whole

699
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,039
positioning of of TJ Maxx is U if we

700
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,240
give you brand names for Less

701
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,960
and the reason why it's important is

702
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,039
because very often when you see low

703
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,159
price uh you think it's low price

704
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,720
because the quality of the product is

705
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,919
low but if the customer knows and trusts

706
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,440
the brand then they won't assume the

707
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,799
price is low because it's a bad product

708
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,440
instead Alex says they'll attribute it

709
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,840
to TJ Maxx's ability to get discounted

710
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
goods and because people often expect

711
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,120
name brand items to be more expensive

712
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,360
the brand itself acts as an anchor

713
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,760
emphasizing the fact that as a customer

714
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,000
you're getting a

715
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
deal uh makes people feel good it's not

716
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,360
only I'm getting a low price but I'm

717
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,240
actually getting a deal uh which makes

718
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,640
people feel good about themselves that

719
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,440
they're smart Shoppers TJ Maxx says it

720
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,080
gets its goods from about 21,000 vendors

721
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,799
and the inventory in its stores is

722
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,640
constantly turning so as a result people

723
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,240
tend to go more often to this type of

724
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,559
stores and also spend a little bit more

725
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,000
time in the store in search of something

726
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,200
across its companies TJX employs more

727
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,360
than 1200 buyers that each control

728
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,320
millions of dollars and has authority to

729
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,480
cut deals on the spot as a buyer for TJ

730
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
Maxx I'm always on the hunt let's say

731
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,200
you have a bathing suit brand and it's

732
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
the right before Memorial Day weekend

733
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,640
and they're stuck with extra bathing

734
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,919
suits that's when TJ Maxx buyers show up

735
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:45,120
at the showroom you know they can cut a

736
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,960
deal right on the spot and they can get

737
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,080
it to their stores within a week

738
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,679
department stores on the other hand can

739
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,519
take weeks to review and approve orders

740
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,799
from their buyers so TJ MOX buys the

741
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,880
merchandise quickly and gets it into the

742
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,360
store just as fast they have a saying

743
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,159
internally door to floor in 24 meaning

744
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,080
that any merchandise that shows up at a

745
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,519
store in the morning has to be on the

746
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,840
sales floor by the end of that day to

747
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,000
ensure speed merchandise often arrives

748
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,480
at stores already on racks that

749
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,360
employees wheel off trucks and move

750
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,240
straight onto the sales floor and once

751
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,320
it's there all the merchandise is laid

752
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,360
out differently than other retailers too

753
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,159
helping to create that treasure hunt

754
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,279
experience while most department stores

755
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,039
group items by brand TJ Maxx organizes

756
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,440
its inventory by type this means that

757
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,080
different brands can end up next to each

758
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,480
other on the same racks and since TJ

759
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,039
Maxx doesn't have walls dividing

760
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,480
sections of the stores or Brands it can

761
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,200
easily reconfigure the layout based on

762
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,519
changing inventory seeing all the

763
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,960
products and changing layout can

764
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
encourage impulse buying Shoppers know

765
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,480
that if they see something they like

766
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,600
they need to buy it now if they wait it

767
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,399
may be sold out or hard to find when

768
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:52,440
they come back once you take it home

769
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,320
things are changing dramatically because

770
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,399
now you're not buying something you you

771
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:59,480
are giving up something lots of research

772
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,279
has shown that giving up something is

773
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,919
more difficult than acquiring you're

774
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,760
willing to uh pay more uh not to give up

775
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,320
something than to buy something

776
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,840
retailers struggled through the rise of

777
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,120
e-commerce in the pandemic and while TJ

778
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,640
X's off-price retailers still took a hit

779
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,640
they have bounced back in 2021 TJX had

780
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,159
the highest sales in the company's

781
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,440
history a record it then beat the

782
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,760
following year and it's not because TJ

783
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,480
Maxx and the other off-price retailers

784
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,559
adapted but rather because they never

785
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,960
drifted away from their core strategy TJ

786
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,919
Maxx tends to perform pretty well in an

787
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,559
economic downturn because that's when

788
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,880
customers tend to be bargain conscious

789
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,799
and you know they offer really good

790
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,039
value for the money let's say you wanted

791
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,760
to buy a popular Rolex Daytona watch a

792
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,120
new one would cost you

793
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
$14,800 but if you wanted to buy a used

794
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,640
version of the same watch you might need

795
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,679
to pay over

796
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,279
$38,000 so why people spending more

797
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,799
money to get a used Rolex if you use

798
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,080
your watch primarily for 10 in the time

799
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,880
then we're not of the same mindset

800
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,600
here's why the used watch Market is

801
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,760
booming and what Rolex is doing to get

802
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,120
in on the action this is the economics

803
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,770
of used

804
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,440
[Music]

805
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,799
Rolexes experts suggest that it takes

806
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,880
about a year to make a Rolex and weight

807
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,960
list for new watches can last months to

808
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,399
years and because of that these days you

809
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,200
can't walk into any Rolex store any

810
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
Rolex dealer and just get any watch that

811
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,039
you want for the past few years as

812
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,159
demand has increased Rolex has not been

813
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:33,799
able to keep up with that demand their

814
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,600
production just can't match the number

815
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,399
of people that want a Rolex if you've

816
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:39,519
got 10 $220,000 to burn you really want

817
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,159
a watch you're probably going to go to

818
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:42,720
the resale Market because the watch that

819
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,760
you want is going to be available there

820
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,880
and so the prices on the resale Market

821
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,480
have then gone up because there's more

822
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,360
people going to that market 29% of

823
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,159
collectors reported paying more than

824
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,960
retail price for their most recent

825
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,880
pre-owned watch according to a report

826
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,679
from Boston Consulting Group and 40%

827
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,799
said that one of their top reasons was

828
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,399
that they were able to avoid long

829
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,159
waiting lists in the firsthand Market

830
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,039
this has created a boom in the secondary

831
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,000
Market pre-owned watch sales reached 22

832
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,159
billion in 2021 the used sector is

833
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,080
actually growing faster than the primary

834
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,600
market and for some people used watches

835
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,679
are worth more than new ones that's

836
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:22,320
because some rare styles are more

837
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,080
desirable or because Rolex has

838
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,519
discontinued certain models and colors

839
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,320
in in older model Rolex can have a

840
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,080
patina it can have some wear marks and

841
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,600
so those kind of personal details those

842
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,320
kind of personal age marks those are

843
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,080
things that collectors might want there

844
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,919
is also a bragging rights thing where if

845
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,159
you have a Rolex from the 70s or the 80s

846
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,399
you're able to say it's from this era

847
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,720
it's you know 20 30 years older than I

848
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,360
am and that is just kind of cool to

849
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,279
collectors in a way the market about a

850
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,399
decade ago was softer than it is right

851
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,559
now back then you could sell a watch and

852
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,519
get a return on it but you could also

853
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,159
sell a Rolex and it could have

854
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,639
depreciated value when you could lose

855
00:32:57,639 --> 00:32:59,919
money on it these days you now will

856
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,639
likely make more money off of it if you

857
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,679
sell it on the resale Market much of the

858
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,799
success of the used watch Market is due

859
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,679
to the rise of online watch resale

860
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,519
marketplaces over the past decade that's

861
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,120
where people like Paul and Carol come in

862
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,880
can yell at get over there buddy the

863
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,320
husband and wife Duo run Bob's watches

864
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,919
an online Marketplace for buying selling

865
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:23,240
and trading luxury watches they say that

866
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,720
they currently have one of the largest

867
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,159
selections of used Rolex watches in the

868
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,399
world I started out in the watch

869
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:32,159
business because I could see that there

870
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,360
was no real safe transparent honest

871
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,200
place for people to buy and sell

872
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,840
pre-owned watches it's been an upward

873
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,039
Trend since 2010 we've been growing

874
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,600
consistently about 30 to 40%

875
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,360
year-over-year two years ago we did uh

876
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,200
$100 million in sales there's so much

877
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,519
more for us to tap into that we haven't

878
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,200
had the bandwidth to get to because the

879
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,440
growth has been so so fast and furious

880
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,559
and Paul and Carol love Rolexes sales of

881
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,760
used watches online already exceed

882
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,840
auction and store sales and one report

883
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,480
predicts they're going to reach close to

884
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,440
60% of the secondhand luxury Market by

885
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,480
2026 during the pandemic the stock

886
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,199
market goes crazy you have the kind of

887
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,199
crypto phenomenon you have meme stocks

888
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,119
happening and people have a lot of extra

889
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,760
capital and they're taking that in many

890
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,159
cases and they're putting it toward

891
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,719
assets um luxury goods and in a lot of

892
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,399
cases watches starting in 2020 used

893
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,280
luxury watches sold for 1.5 to three

894
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,359
times their retail prices Rolex is a

895
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,800
brand that's really recognizable in its

896
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,719
design it's you know easy to spot on the

897
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,440
street and a lot of people they'll see

898
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,918
that their friend has a given Rolex and

899
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,679
they think I want that too but Rolex the

900
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,280
company only sold new watches which

901
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,839
meant that the brand wasn't involved

902
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,159
with used watch sales that is until late

903
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,280
2022 Rolex opened a certified pre-owned

904
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,800
program for its used watches retailers

905
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,879
can send used Rolexes that are at least

906
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,440
3 years old back to the watch maker the

907
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,720
certified pre-own program verifies that

908
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,880
a watch is an authentic Rolex and works

909
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,520
properly then retailers can sell the

910
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,960
watch with an official Rolex certificate

911
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,760
the program is already active in one

912
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,200
retail chain in six different countries

913
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,760
another chain of official Rolex

914
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
retailers in the US will enter the

915
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,160
program this may buying a watch with

916
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,359
Rolex certification could be a draw for

917
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,680
firsttime buyers you're buying a watch

918
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,040
on the internet it can be a little bit

919
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,079
of a daunting experience of all the

920
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,960
watches on our website today almost 50%

921
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,440
of them already have the original box

922
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,760
and papers from Rolex we've offered a

923
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,839
CPO program a certified pre-owned

924
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,800
program now for almost 5 years the only

925
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,160
thing really new about it is that Rolex

926
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,960
is certifying and doing the paperwork

927
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,880
behind it so I don't feel that there's

928
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,240
any increased competition but I do feel

929
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,280
that the market is big enough for

930
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,319
everybody to participate today people

931
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:52,440
buy Rolexes online the way that they

932
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,920
might buy toilet paper so it's really

933
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,040
not a premium or specialized experience

934
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,400
there's still that consumer that wants

935
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,720
to have that experience of going into a

936
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,319
store of being waited on of kind of

937
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:02,839
being shown watches from a glass display

938
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:04,880
case and making it feel more special

939
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,040
because they're buying something of such

940
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,240
a high value this certified pre-owned

941
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,319
program means that Rolex can take a cut

942
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:12,280
out of a market that it previously left

943
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,599
untapped but things might continue to

944
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,880
shift for the luxury watch Market the

945
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,960
used watch Market is cooling down as

946
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
sellers eager to make a profit have

947
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,440
flooded the market with inventory recent

948
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,680
data shows the number of Rolex watches

949
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,920
available to buy second in hand roughly

950
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,599
doubled from the beginning of 2022 to

951
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,160
September of the same year on those

952
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,000
really coveted kind of brand name

953
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,200
watches so to speak the ones that

954
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,119
collectors talk about the resale value

955
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,760
has gone down a little bit resellers

956
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,520
people that watch that market they do

957
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,200
say that the prices have come back down

958
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,720
to earth a little bit but the volume of

959
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,800
sales the amount of sales happening that

960
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,440
Still Remains pretty high we're seeing

961
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,079
still a large number of transactions in

962
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,760
the resale Market your day and day out

963
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,720
Rolex is still retaining a lot of value

964
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,160
on the resale Market you can still get a

965
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,880
pretty good return turn for it as with

966
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,560
any resale Market there is a risk that

967
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,520
the Rolex Market can fall out at any

968
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,200
time 5 years ago we might not have been

969
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,520
talking about how crazy this Market is

970
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,040
and 5 years from now we might not be

971
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,720
talking about how crazy this Market is

972
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,520
the market is so large that to a certain

973
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,079
extent both things can be true you know

974
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,319
people that watch this Market will say

975
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:13,480
that that's just actually a reflection

976
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,400
of how big the market is now where it

977
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,119
can behave in many different ways just

978
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,200
because it is this kind of really large

979
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,520
transactional Marketplace this is what

980
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,160
Nintendo originally was yes it was a

981
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,680
playing card company and this is

982
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,359
Nintendo today me Mario consoles theme

983
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,960
parks even movies so what has driven the

984
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,920
$44 billion Empire this is the economics

985
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
of

986
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,839
Nintendo Nintendo is different from its

987
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,720
competitors Sony and Microsoft thanks in

988
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,960
part to its lowcost Hardware Microsoft's

989
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,040
Xbox makes no profit on its Hardware

990
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,359
consoles are actually sold at a loss in

991
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,960
the market so when somebody goes and

992
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,839
they buy an Xbox at their local retailer

993
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,560
uh we're subsidizing that purchase

994
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,720
somewhere between $1 and $200 with the

995
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,280
expectation that we will recoup that

996
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,400
investment over time through accessory

997
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,720
sales and storefront and Sony only

998
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,520
recently began to make a profit on the

999
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,440
PlayStation 5 then there's Nintendo

1000
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,000
their technology is usually five or six

1001
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,480
years behind in terms of

1002
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,560
state-of-the-art but that means that

1003
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,640
they're cheaper to produce and that

1004
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,400
means Nintendo is much much more

1005
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,680
profitable on their Hardware business

1006
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,440
about half of Nintendo's profit in 2022

1007
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,400
came from Hardware Sales they've

1008
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,000
dominated the market when it comes to

1009
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,920
handheld consoles one of its big

1010
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,280
successes the Game Boy launched in

1011
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,200
1989 Nintendo was really early to the

1012
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,319
party uh with handheld they're kind of

1013
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,119
credited with inventing the console

1014
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,400
although they were probably third or

1015
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,599
fourth the game boy had a longer battery

1016
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,280
life compared to some of its competitors

1017
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,760
for four Shades of Gray nuanced gameplay

1018
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,960
and had Tetris one of the top selling

1019
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,359
video games of all time eventually

1020
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,119
Nintendo's Game Boy became the third

1021
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,960
most sold console in the company's

1022
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,839
history selling 119 million units to

1023
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,480
date the company continued to innovate

1024
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
releasing new hardware for its games

1025
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,560
from the GameCube Nintendo DS the wiii

1026
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,480
and to its most recent success the

1027
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,359
switch with more than 122 million units

1028
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,319
sold you can play it at home like a

1029
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,040
console on your big screen TV but you

1030
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,520
could pick it up and take it on the go

1031
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,960
and it becomes a handheld device and

1032
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,319
that's pretty novel we haven't really

1033
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:33,319
seen anything that's a hybrid like that

1034
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:35,599
before sales of the switch device and

1035
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,359
its games accounted for about 94% of

1036
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,760
Nintendo sales revenue in its 2021

1037
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,240
fiscal year and today it's the second

1038
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
bestselling game console in Nintendo's

1039
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,359
history and continues to be a driving

1040
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,599
factor of its Revenue the success of

1041
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,079
Nintendo's consoles is also due to its

1042
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,680
software in other words its games in

1043
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,720
2022 Nintendo had had 19 first party

1044
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,079
titles that sold over a million units

1045
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,839
each exclusive to its consoles the

1046
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:04,960
difference between the others and

1047
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,200
Nintendo is that Nintendo historically

1048
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,400
has produced about 50% of all the games

1049
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,359
sold on its Hardware system and the

1050
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:16,960
other guys are typically under 10% of

1051
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,160
the game sold on their systems so they

1052
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,119
make a small fraction of the software

1053
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,920
that's played on PlayStation and Xbox

1054
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,680
Nintendo makes more than half recent

1055
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,480
Point Animal Crossing New Horizon's

1056
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,880
release in April 2020 created higher

1057
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,480
demand for the only console carrying it

1058
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,319
the switch Nintendo makes games

1059
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:36,839
exclusively for the most part for its

1060
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,800
own devices if you want to play a

1061
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,160
Nintendo game like Legend of Zelda you

1062
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,520
need Nintendo Hardware in fact

1063
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,440
Nintendo's first party games generate

1064
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,240
over 70% of its sales its best sellers

1065
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,880
in 2022 were all Nintendo first party

1066
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,240
games and the type of content Nintendo

1067
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,040
makes is also different than its

1068
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
competitors let's keep in mind

1069
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,680
Nintendo's characters are very

1070
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,200
cute

1071
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,560
Mario Nintendo is known for making

1072
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,480
familyfriendly games for the most part

1073
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,880
so it appeals to a different crowd than

1074
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,640
some of the other Publishers you won't

1075
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,280
see blood or Gore or foul language but

1076
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,160
even Nintendo couple years ago dabbled

1077
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,839
into the shooter genre when we think of

1078
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,079
Shooters right we think of Call of Duty

1079
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,000
fortnite uh they take a very

1080
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,160
familyfriendly approach with Splatoon

1081
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,359
it's a shooter but you're shooting

1082
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:24,680
paintballs the company's next iteration

1083
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,520
bringing these familyfriendly characters

1084
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,560
to a larger Arena and building another

1085
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,800
generation of fans in February 2023

1086
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,000
Nintendo opened its first theme park

1087
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,280
outside of Japan and in April it's

1088
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,480
releasing a Super Mario Brothers movie

1089
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,880
starring Chris Pratt it's a me a Mario

1090
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,920
that's smart because that's going to

1091
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,280
expose the Nintendo brand to hundreds of

1092
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,800
millions of people who haven't ever

1093
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,880
owned a switch I don't think that

1094
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,160
Nintendo is necessarily worried about

1095
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,560
whether somebody who goes to the theme

1096
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,000
park will buy buy a Nintendo console or

1097
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,240
buy a game but they want those people to

1098
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,599
be aware of the Nintendo Brands and they

1099
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,400
want them to know who Mario is and who

1100
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,280
Zelda is and who Yoshi is and who Pikman

1101
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,800
is it is risky to start a new franchise

1102
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,560
and sometimes new properties just don't

1103
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,280
resonate um but they have plenty a very

1104
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,520
deep library and they've stuck with that

1105
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,280
for the most part and iterated on it and

1106
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,960
modernized it we'll probably be playing

1107
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,599
Legends of Zelda for another 20 30 years

1108
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,240
Mario is probably not going anywhere you

1109
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,319
now he's just going to live forever and

1110
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,160
keep that mustache and keep everyone

1111
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,280
happy for many years to come this Barnes

1112
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,200
& Noble in Pikesville Maryland used to

1113
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,280
be in a 24,000 ft space in this building

1114
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280
now it's moved across the street to a

1115
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,359
space that's less than half the

1116
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,079
size and with the downsizing came a new

1117
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,160
look and new books chosen specifically

1118
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,880
for this store's customers it's all part

1119
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,920
of Barnes & Noble strategy to tailor

1120
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,800
each of the company's more than 600

1121
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,800
location to local tastes Barnes & Noble

1122
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,839
is adopting the strategy of independent

1123
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,559
bookstores that it once put out of

1124
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,480
business here's how the book seller is

1125
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,640
implementing its new approach and why it

1126
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,960
thinks this new strategy will sell more

1127
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,920
books this is the economics of Barnes

1128
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,910
and

1129
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,040
[Music]

1130
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,559
Noble Barnes & Noble was first founded

1131
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,880
in 1873 in 1971 Leonard Rio acquired the

1132
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,440
company which set off a period of growth

1133
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,200
the retailer went public in 1993 in an

1134
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,119
era when it was opening Superstores

1135
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:31,240
across the country in the 1990s and

1136
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,599
2000s Barnes & Noble bookstores really

1137
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,000
looked like large supermarkets filled

1138
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,079
with books usually anchoring strip

1139
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,920
centers in the suburbs or rural areas

1140
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,200
and whether in Phoenix or Maryland or

1141
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,640
Ohio the stores had the same books with

1142
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,040
the same furniture and the same layout

1143
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,480
it either had one floor or it had two if

1144
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,680
had two it had enormous escalators going

1145
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,119
out with this huge sort of open space in

1146
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:58,319
the middle to an upper floor that model

1147
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,599
happened to be extremely scalable they

1148
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,760
were trying to fill their stores with

1149
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,280
books and infrastructure at the lowest

1150
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,319
cost possible so they wanted to order

1151
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,240
all the same types of bookshelves the

1152
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,800
same type of furnishings and decorations

1153
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,839
and other autra mths so the company grew

1154
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:17,839
and fast those huge stores carried more

1155
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,880
books at lower prices than independent

1156
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,920
book stores we all remember the romcom

1157
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,400
new got mail Joe Fox I'm in the book

1158
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,800
business I am in the book business so

1159
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,640
many closed when Barnes & Noble came to

1160
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,480
town they weren't able to compete with

1161
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,640
the title selection or prices that

1162
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,119
Barnes Noble offered but big stores and

1163
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,240
large inventories weren't enough to save

1164
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,640
Barnes & Noble from a digital threat

1165
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,079
Amazon was able to offer kind of like

1166
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,200
Barnes & Noble had in the past a huge

1167
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,400
selection of titles at lower prices than

1168
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,960
Barnes & Noble could because it didn't

1169
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,440
have the cost of real estate and other

1170
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,040
uh costs that Barnes & Noble was

1171
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,319
shouldering and it sunk a lot of money

1172
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:58,119
trying to keep Pace particularly in Nook

1173
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:00,640
it's e-reader business take your story

1174
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,359
wherever you want it to go but nothing

1175
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,480
helped stop the bleeding the company's

1176
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,640
Revenue has declined since

1177
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,960
2012 then in 2019 hedge fund Elliot

1178
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,720
Management Corporation acquired the

1179
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,960
chain and installed James da who led

1180
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,880
British retailer waterstones and founded

1181
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,040
his own independent bookstore da books

1182
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,800
as CEO it felt entirely intuitive to me

1183
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,960
that you allow each bookstore to run as

1184
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,400
an independent bookstore they will

1185
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,280
create much more interesting much more

1186
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,760
Dynamic much more engaging bookstores

1187
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,400
and that meant reminding people about

1188
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,760
the appeal of inperson versus online

1189
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,000
shopping what you're missing is the

1190
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,280
opportunity to kind of read the book

1191
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,280
flaps of all the other books that are

1192
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,079
there and maybe get recommendations from

1193
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,800
the local book seller who's working

1194
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,880
there the company says it wanted to

1195
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,640
emphasize the experience of visiting a

1196
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,359
physical bookstore so its new strategy

1197
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:54,200
strips stores of the cookie cutter look

1198
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,319
and feel that had helped the change grow

1199
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,640
its revenue and store count some

1200
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,559
locations have moved on from The Big Box

1201
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:02,880
model to smaller stores and in these

1202
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,240
smaller spaces they are reconfiguring

1203
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,760
the stores so that they're more of a

1204
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,480
maze and less of a supermarket aisle

1205
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,559
plus the company says each individual

1206
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:13,800
store has more autonomy over what books

1207
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,520
to order and how to display them here at

1208
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,400
the Pikesville Maryland location the

1209
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,200
store manager says that customers like

1210
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,319
romance books from Black authors and

1211
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,720
lots of fiction so the large romance

1212
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,680
section is at the front of the store and

1213
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,200
there's a huge display right in the

1214
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,640
center celebrating Black History Month

1215
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,480
store managers can also choose how to

1216
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,800
run promotions like this buy one get one

1217
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,280
50% off deal on specific fiction books

1218
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,720
chosen by the team here Brooklyn has a

1219
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,359
very different demographic very

1220
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,319
different set of customers a very

1221
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:46,640
different set of book interests to let's

1222
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,480
say somebody in Alabama in Georgia who

1223
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,040
is the best person to judge what those

1224
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,079
particular communities want to by it the

1225
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,280
book sellers in those communities the

1226
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,119
company has also been listening to its

1227
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,319
store managers on wider Trends manga was

1228
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:05,160
a small part of our assortment we had

1229
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,920
maybe five six Bays of books on manga

1230
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,559
And yet when these book sellers were

1231
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:11,040
reorganizing their stores they were

1232
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,880
coming back to us saying we want to do

1233
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,920
38 you know we want to do 42 which was

1234
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,200
just almost sort of incomprehensible

1235
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,680
except that's what they said their

1236
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,400
customers would respond to D also used

1237
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,160
this localizing strategy to turn around

1238
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,200
British books store chain water stones

1239
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,359
which reported a 42.9 million pound loss

1240
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:34,480
across 268 stores in 2012 compared to a

1241
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,160
16.32 million pound profit across 278

1242
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,319
stores 6 years later the two businesses

1243
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:44,960
are on paper identical it had had

1244
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,599
identical histories um and had reached

1245
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,720
an identical point of failure that's why

1246
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,640
Barnes & Noble relinquished some control

1247
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,160
to individual stores but that comes with

1248
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,680
its own set of of challenges for the

1249
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,079
company you could walk into a bookstore

1250
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,640
and find out that it's really not doing

1251
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,680
well the manager's choices aren't

1252
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,319
appealing to customers and books aren't

1253
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,280
selling still Barnes & Noble says the

1254
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,599
strategy is promising for the first time

1255
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:10,400
in more than a decade the company is

1256
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,440
planning on opening more stores than it

1257
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,680
closes in

1258
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,280
2023 we've seen a balancing in which

1259
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,680
much higher percentage of our sales are

1260
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,559
coming from books and books are growing

1261
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:21,640
really very dramatically if you run

1262
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,640
better bookstores you sell more books

1263
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,160
this is what Lego products looked like

1264
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,400
in the

1265
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:33,000
1980s and this is a Lego Product

1266
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,280
now that's because the company has

1267
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,800
become more than just blocks they have

1268
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,760
video games movies theme parks all these

1269
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,040
activities which ultimately reinforce

1270
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,800
the core which is the sale of Lego sets

1271
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,480
all that content helped it become the

1272
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,880
world's largest toy maker breaking in

1273
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,280
billions of dollars every year here's

1274
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,480
how the company uses licensing deals in

1275
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,280
media to expand it its customer base and

1276
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,000
build its content Empire this is the

1277
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,760
economics of Lego Lego is 90 years old

1278
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,440
it was founded in Denmark in 1932 and

1279
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,760
initially it was a company that made

1280
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,799
wooden toys but then in the 1950s it

1281
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:13,799
launched its trademark product the one

1282
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:15,960
we all know now the the plastic Lego

1283
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,559
brick since then Lego has beat out

1284
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,599
Hasbro and metel to become the biggest

1285
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:23,160
toy brand worldwide in the first 6

1286
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,680
months of 2022 the company's Revenue h

1287
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,280
27 billion Danish croner or about $ 3.47

1288
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,160
billion up 177% from 2021 and it's

1289
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,760
anticipating growing demand so much so

1290
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,280
that the company is building two new

1291
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,680
factories in the US and Vietnam Lego has

1292
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,319
made the bricks the building blocks of

1293
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:44,119
its business Lego is still essentially a

1294
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,960
toy company what what they always say is

1295
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,480
their core is still to make the plastic

1296
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,520
bricks for kids but of course they do

1297
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,440
now do a lot more than that some of

1298
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,799
LEGO's first moves into content started

1299
00:49:54,799 --> 00:49:57,880
in the 199 90s Island behind us when the

1300
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,400
company's sales slumped it was trying

1301
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,079
everything from new toys to electronics

1302
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:06,280
to theme parks can you find the power

1303
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,920
Bionicle Bionicle came along in the

1304
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,359
early 2000s and that was a time when the

1305
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,799
LEGO brand was actually in danger of

1306
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:14,920
becoming a little bit stale the bionical

1307
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,559
franchise featured buildable action

1308
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,200
figures and multiplatform storytelling

1309
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,400
agile determined Unstoppable the

1310
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,400
franchise built a Content Universe

1311
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,680
through Comics books movies and video

1312
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,000
games the BET proved successful in 2003

1313
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,599
when the toy maker saw a 26% loss in net

1314
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:35,839
sales Bionicle was its bestselling line

1315
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,160
and it really revitalized the brand and

1316
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,559
and showed them a way that they could

1317
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:42,880
engage audiences with different types of

1318
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,079
content with cartoons

1319
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,359
movies comics and it wasn't just

1320
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,799
Original Stories Lego released its first

1321
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:52,280
sets based off of licensed material in

1322
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,720
1999 Star Wars in 2005 it it brought

1323
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,760
that into content with a 5-minute short

1324
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,680
called revenge of the brick that aired

1325
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,760
on Cartoon

1326
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,079
Network it was a Twist of course on the

1327
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,079
Revenge of the Sith which was the the

1328
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,599
Star Wars movie which came out at the

1329
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,799
time that really paved the way for the

1330
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:11,480
for the content Partnerships which we've

1331
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,280
seen in subsequent years that Lego twist

1332
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,160
has since been put to use on all sorts

1333
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,720
of franchises like Batman Marvel and

1334
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,079
Jurassic world really we're now used to

1335
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:23,359
seeing not just the basic Lego kits but

1336
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,680
Lego Star Wars kits and and so on that's

1337
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,599
really an integral part of what Lego

1338
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,400
does now so it's really the content has

1339
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,760
has changed Lego's identity we think of

1340
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,760
it as part of these popular franchises

1341
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,839
which we all know like Marvel and

1342
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,040
licensed material was on full display on

1343
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,119
the company's Smash Hit 2014's The Lego

1344
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,240
Movie which grossed over $450 million

1345
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,760
worldwide it held the top spot in the US

1346
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,480
box office for 3 weeks after its release

1347
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,280
Superman Wonder Woman the mermaid

1348
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,359
Michelangelo and the 2002 NBA allar the

1349
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,359
goal of the Lego movie was to Market

1350
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,319
Lego to a wider audience I think it was

1351
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,680
a lot more successful than anyone

1352
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,960
imagined it was a very successful movie

1353
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,799
in its own right a big hit at the box

1354
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:09,839
office that laid the template for for a

1355
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,240
lot of the content creation that Lego

1356
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,000
has done since then Lego and Warner

1357
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,839
Brothers released three more feature

1358
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:18,280
films the latest in 2019 none earned as

1359
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,640
much as the first of course there is a

1360
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,920
risk of oversaturation Lego doesn't want

1361
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,599
to do too much but but I think think

1362
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,319
they're still very much at the stage of

1363
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:29,520
growing in a lot of markets content has

1364
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,280
helped the toy maker break into new

1365
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,520
places like China where Lego is growing

1366
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,040
its presence of the 66 new stores it

1367
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,079
opened in the first half of 2022 46 of

1368
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:41,680
those were in China almost 42% of the

1369
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,839
company's 833 locations are there movies

1370
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:46,880
and games assist in raising awareness of

1371
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,520
the brand the main challenge Lego faced

1372
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,160
in in New Markets like China is that the

1373
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,079
grown-ups the parents just don't really

1374
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:54,760
know about Lego they don't have Lego in

1375
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,440
their in their own backgrounds like a

1376
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,680
lot of grown-ups in in the US and Europe

1377
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,960
do and using licensed material in that

1378
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,480
content also helps reach more audiences

1379
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,760
being part of these popular franchises

1380
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,640
like The Avengers for example is a great

1381
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,960
way for Lego to to reach out to all

1382
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,640
kinds of different Generations people

1383
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,520
across the world people who don't

1384
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,760
necessarily even know Lego content is

1385
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,799
also a way for it to appeal to its adult

1386
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:22,960
fans as the brand has been trying to do

1387
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,760
in recent years find your flow

1388
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,559
build with Lego bricks reality TV show

1389
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,839
Lego Masters for example features adults

1390
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:33,079
building extreme Creations out of the

1391
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:36,119
titular plastic bricks the original Lego

1392
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,160
fans took to Lego as kids and they're

1393
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,359
now grown up and and a lot of those

1394
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:42,400
people are still very keen on Lego and I

1395
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,599
think Lego very smartly realized that a

1396
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:47,079
lot of those people would be willing to

1397
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:49,839
to buy kits that are are pretty complex

1398
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,280
pretty expensive and are designed

1399
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,119
specifically for for grown-ups the

1400
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,839
company has its eyes set Beyond just the

1401
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,559
$2 dimensional screen last April Lego

1402
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,400
and epic games announced a partnership

1403
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,160
to build a digital experience in the

1404
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,400
metaverse all of this content certainly

1405
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,240
in the company's current thinking the

1406
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,920
movies the games that all is there to

1407
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,280
support the core product which is the

1408
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,000
same as it has been for decades the

1409
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,880
plastic brick your last pizza probably

1410
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,880
came in a box like this it's cardboard

1411
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,359
stur and most importantly keeps your

1412
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,839
cheese from getting stuck to the lid and

1413
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,000
that's thanks to Domino's whose founder

1414
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,720
is widely credited with creating the

1415
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,200
corrugated pizza box it's just one of

1416
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,119
the company's Innovations not in pizza

1417
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,119
but in

1418
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:38,240
delivery in 2022 more than 40% of online

1419
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,400
delivery orders for major pizza chains

1420
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,760
were from dominoes here's how the

1421
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,440
company made its name in the pizza

1422
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,359
delivery market and why this

1423
00:54:46,359 --> 00:54:48,359
foundational piece of its business is

1424
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:51,040
facing new challenges this is the

1425
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,359
economics of

1426
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,440
Domino's Domino's it's a

1427
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,240
Del dominoes originally called Dominics

1428
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,040
acquired its first restaurant in 1960 in

1429
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,520
ipsilanti Michigan and jumped into the

1430
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,559
delivery business the same year

1431
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:09,240
something very few restaurants were

1432
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,559
doing at the time you're now we think of

1433
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,240
delivery as being so ubiquitous I mean

1434
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,760
so many types of restaurants have

1435
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,520
delivery But Domino's was there very

1436
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,000
early at scale one reason it's become so

1437
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,720
well known for its delivery is a

1438
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,760
campaign the company started in the 80s

1439
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,039
PR ing delivery in less than 30 minutes

1440
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:30,240
within 30 minutes only Domino's Pizza

1441
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,319
delivers in 30 minutes or less people

1442
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,079
really did have the sense that once they

1443
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,640
ordered that pizza they were going to

1444
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,400
get it to their homes quickly and I

1445
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,599
think that really helped for marketing

1446
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,440
Domino's ended that guarantee in 1993

1447
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,359
after a delivery driver struck another

1448
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:47,440
vehicle resulting in a lawsuit but by

1449
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,520
then the company had cemented its place

1450
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,839
in delivery and in the half century

1451
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,160
since Domino's was founded it's paid off

1452
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,079
it took the biggest slice of pizza chain

1453
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:58,599
sales in

1454
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,119
2022 Domino's success is due in part to

1455
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:03,880
creativity and every step of its

1456
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,359
delivery process starting with stores

1457
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,880
many are small and often with little or

1458
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,400
no dining space a model the company has

1459
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,640
said allowed for lower rents and reduced

1460
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,720
store expenses over the years Domino's

1461
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,559
has also focused on establishing more

1462
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:22,760
than 6,500 locations in the US and has

1463
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,640
worked with franchisees to extend their

1464
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,760
reach

1465
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,160
so one part of Domino's strategy is

1466
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,400
what's called Fortress which is making

1467
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,720
sure there's enough pizza shops in a

1468
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,160
certain mile radius that wherever your

1469
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,440
order goes one of those pizza shops can

1470
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,720
handle it and it can help get it to your

1471
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,960
house quickly the company's supply line

1472
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,640
is also structured to make the pizza

1473
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,280
creation process as quick and uniform as

1474
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,799
possible Domino's has 25 supply chain

1475
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:52,200
centers in the US where dough is mixed

1476
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,280
and toppings are prepared before being

1477
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,880
sold to to franchise stores where pizzas

1478
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,400
are assembled and baked the more pizzas

1479
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,319
that are sold the more money Domino's

1480
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:03,760
makes from its supply chain it made up

1481
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,520
59% of Domino's Revenue in

1482
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,000
2021 the next part of the process is

1483
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,160
ordering in 2008 the company rolled out

1484
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,520
its Advanced online ordering system

1485
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,240
which included a customized Pizza

1486
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,640
Builder and the Pizza Tracker so the

1487
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,720
Pizza Tracker is something that Domino's

1488
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,520
invented they will let you know where it

1489
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,359
is in the process it's whether it's

1490
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,119
being cooked whether it's out for

1491
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,400
delivery where they're approaching

1492
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,559
Domino's has continued to introduce new

1493
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:34,119
ordering options Pizza Emoji sent

1494
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:36,640
Domino's ordered smiley face then

1495
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,680
there's the last step of the process

1496
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,480
getting the pizza from the kitchen to

1497
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,799
your home from working with special

1498
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,280
kinds of insulated bags to creating 3D

1499
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,760
car top signs Domino's has been a big

1500
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,319
innovator in this step the company has

1501
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,200
experimented with several methods of

1502
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,359
delivery vehicles helicopters electric

1503
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:58,280
bikes self-driving cars even cars with a

1504
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,920
heated Pizza Oven it's really putting

1505
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,359
the whole brand behind delivery in a lot

1506
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,359
of ways but after years at the top of

1507
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,799
delivery Domino's is facing new

1508
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:10,240
challenges companies like Uber Eats

1509
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,760
GrubHub and door Dash are eating at

1510
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,200
Domino's business in the US as drivers

1511
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,520
leave pizza for apps with more flexible

1512
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,640
hours it's contributed to an

1513
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,440
industrywide delivery driver shortage

1514
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,440
other chains like Papa John's and Pizza

1515
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,480
Hut have both started working with some

1516
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,400
of these apps but Domino's has resisted

1517
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,400
they argue that that makes it more

1518
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,960
profitable because you're not having to

1519
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,280
pay an outside service to deliver that

1520
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,640
pizza and to Market that pizza on their

1521
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,760
app and it keeps them closer to their

1522
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,119
customers as the company has faced these

1523
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,079
issues its shares have slumped from a

1524
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:46,720
high at the end of

1525
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,680
2021 now Domino's is exploring new

1526
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,880
options the company is building out a

1527
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,920
fleet of electric delivery vehicles to

1528
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,880
recruit new drivers ERS and it's now

1529
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,119
offering customers what it calls a $3

1530
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:01,280
tip to pick up their own pie we see you

00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,520
carry out Heroes you know it's much

1532
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,000
cheaper for them if their customers pick

1533
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,400
up their own pizza and so they are

1534
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,760
getting in the pickup game in a big way

1535
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,480
