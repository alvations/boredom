> I'm at it again. Doing an #nlproc "paper blitz" for @aclmeeting and @emnlpmeeting 2023 papers.

> Let's try live tweeting while I blitz 😁


# Step 0: Judge the paper by its title

> There are soooo many paper this year.

> The only sane way around it is to scope down my #nlproc interest from #neuralempty to general "evaluation", cos these days that is what I work on, and so I literally went to 
@aclanthology and did CTR+F "evalua":


**Time taken:** 20 mins

**Notes:** I didn't restrict myself to "evaluation" papers but when I see something interesting around the evaluation papers, I selected them for blitzing. 


# Step 1: Categorize the papers

The goal here is to categorize the papers selected within 25-30 mins.
